title: RSS Problems With Thunderbird Fixed!

                <p>My RSS Newsfeed (<a href="http://blog.mazedlx.net"><a href="http://blog.mazedlx.net">http://blog.mazedlx.net</a></a>) can now be viewed with Thunderbird in a more appropriate way. Even though the RSS feed was valid before, I had to make a change in the variables in my blog-to-rss script, that would effect the link-tags for each entry.</p>
