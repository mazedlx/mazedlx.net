title: Shortcut Icon / 6 Days To Go...
tag: 
---


                <p>I have made an shortcut icon for maze.wogri.at, which you should see in the address bar beneath <a href="http://maze.wogri.at">http://maze.wogri.at</a>. It represents three slashes ///</p>
<p>6 more days until my master exam. I should get nervous by now, but as far as I know myself, I will get nervous as hell on the day before the exam :-)</p>
