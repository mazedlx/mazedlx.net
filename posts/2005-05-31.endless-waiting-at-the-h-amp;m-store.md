title: Endless Waiting at the H&amp;M Store

                <p>I visited the H&amp;M store in Wiener Neustadt the other day, to get some new bermuda shorts. Walked in, got 2, tried them on - they fit perfectly - off to the cash desk. I queued up at the shortest line, which I shouldn't, always mind Murphy's Law! I waited 15 minutes, standing in a special area, a glass roof above my head, and outside temperatures of 35°C. The cause for this delay was a female customer who tried to exchange a bikini top which she bought recently. Three (!) H&amp;M employees were needed to complete this exchange task.</p>
