title: Why Houses Should Be Numbered In An Appropriate Way
tag:

                <p>On June, 18th, the reunion of <a href="http://www.htlwrn.ac.at">HTBLuVA</a> electrical engineering class of 2000 takes place in Wiener Neustadt. For that reason I drove to our former teachers to hand out the invitations. I reached all of them, but one house I wasn't able to find...because of the numbering system in this special village. The houses aren't numbered the way they are placed, but the way they were built, meaning number 1 stands next to number 134 and number 612 :) I will bring the missing invitation to the post office tomorrow, I hope the mail man knows where to go :)</p>
