                <p>I added some new Origami animals, enough of the modular things for now. Maniac lend me his 'origami insects and their kin'-book, and folding insects, spiders and whatsoever is a much more challenging than folding frogs and flowers.</p>
<p>This Tuesday I'm going to Vienna for my first job interview after my graduation. More news soon.</p>
