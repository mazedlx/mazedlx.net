title: 'Now XHTML 1.1 Valid / The Power of CSS / New Section: Links'
tag: 
---


                <p>I'm very proud to announce that maze.wogri.at is now XHTML 1.1 valid! I encourage every webdesigner/webprogrammer to recode their HTML documents to XHTML and to use only CSS for design purposes. Believe me, someday it will pay off.</p>
<p>Speaking of CSS: I found a very nice site showing what you can do with CSS: <a href="http://www.stunicholls.myby.co.uk/index.html">The CSS Playground</a>. You should use a browser that can handle CSS -&gt; NOT Microsoft Internet Explorer! Use Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, Camino, Konqueror, etc. ...</p>
<p>I opened a new section on maze.wogri.at: Links. The name says it all. There's no picture for that section yet, but thanks to my <a href="http://www.blender3d.com">Blender skills</a> there should be one until next weekend. Before I forget: I already made a 3D picture with blender, you can see it in the About Me section. Just three three-dimensional slashes :)</p>
