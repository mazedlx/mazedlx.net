                <p>Tomorrow Nadine, Diemtar, Sandra and I are going to Italy for our long planned and deserved holiday. You may ask yourself now 'he has only worked one week and is already taking off time?', then let me tell you that this holiday was booked in early January this year :-)
A very special thank you goes out to the web department guys at <a href="http://www.lomography.com">lomography.com</a> for equipping me with two LOMO cameras, a <a href="http://shop.lomography.com/shop/shop_product_view.php?cat=Lomographic%20Cameras&artID=209">LOMO Kompakt Automat</a> and a <a href="http://shop.lomography.com/shop/shop_product_view.php?cat=Lomographic%20Cameras&artID=2651"> Frogeye Underwater</a>, as well as 7 films. As soon as I am back from Italy I'll  upload some pics on maze.wogri.at and on my <a href="http://www.lomography.com/homesDeLuxe/">LomoHome</a>.</p>
