                <p>At the subway station 'Philadelphia Brücke' you'll be able to see all kind of devotees of various sects, for expample Jehova's Witnesses and Mormons. Speaking of Mormons, did you ever see the movie 'Orgazmo'? There's a very special scene where two Mormons approach a nice old lady in her garden:</p>
<p>Elder Young: We're from The Church of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Old Lady: Oh, Mormons.</p>
<p>Elder Young: That's right, I'm Elder Young, and this is Elder White.</p>
<p>Old Lady: Well, you boys can just fuck right off.</p>
<p>Elder Young: Ma'am?</p>
<p>Old Lady: You heard me. Take that book of Mormons and shove it so far up your righteous asses that you choke, you soul soliciting pigfuckers.</p>
<p>:-D</p>
