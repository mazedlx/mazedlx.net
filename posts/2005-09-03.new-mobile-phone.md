                <p>My brand-new mobile phone arrived yesterday. I bought the new <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=at&lc=de&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10242&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10242">SonyEricsson K750i</a> and sold my <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=at&lc=de&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10139&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10139">K700i</a> via <a href="http://www.ebay.at">eBay</a>.
The K750i has everything you've ever wanted from a mobile phone: 2 megapixel camera with autofocus and cameralight, videocamera, bluetooth, mp3 player, fm radio, memory stick duo (with capacities up to 2 gigabyte) and so on.</p>
