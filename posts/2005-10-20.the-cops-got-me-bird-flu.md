                <p>Yesterday, when <a href="http://toomaniac.com">maniac</a> and I drove home from our weekly pool billard session we got stopped by the police. They wanted to see a driving license from us, and checked our data for about 15 minutes. Just like in the movies...</p>
<p>The Bird Flu is finally coming to Europe, which means that the price for chicken burgers will drop immediatly. My mom made me a turkey sandwich, which should be bird-flu-free, cause the meat got cooked beforehand. A wise advice is not to sleep in the same bed with fowl and to broil it before consumption, to avoid getting the bird flu. In the end chicken tastes much better on a BBQ than uncooked ;-)</p>
