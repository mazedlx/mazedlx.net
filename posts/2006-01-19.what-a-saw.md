                <p>The train station I get off my train in Vienna is currently being renovated, so some gates are closed. The used tools are a little bit larger than usual, some look like Binford's new professional series stuff ;-) The workers use a circular saw which saw blade has a diameter of about 1.50 metres. This circular saw also features a protective cover, which wasn't in use this morning. Those protective covers have their right to exist: first of all, when a worker comes across this saw his or her head won't fall off out of a sudden, and on the other hand, when the saw blade disengages itself, nobody gets killed :-) I don't want to get killed either, so I gained speed by walking a bit faster than usual to get pass that building site :-)</p>
