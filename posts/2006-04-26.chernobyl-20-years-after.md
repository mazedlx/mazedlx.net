                <p>Today is the 20th anniversary of one of the worst maximum credible accidents, which happend on April 26th, 1986. At that time I was a 5 year old child, and I believe I can remeber my Mom said to me: 'You must not go outside, because there is this toxic cloud floating around us'. I stood at the window the whole time, and tried to find this damn cloud, which was the cause that I wasn't allowed to play outside. A few days after when it was 'save' to go outside, I still tried to find that cloud :-)</p>
