title: First Ride With Bandit / My Finger Bleeds
tag: 
---


                <p>On Saturday I decided to ride my Bandit for the first time this year. The weather seemed stable - until I got home. I drove the last five kilometres in a heavy rain shower, and when I finally arrived at home the rain did stop all out of a sudden :-/
I also tried to clean the doorboards of my car that day. When I reached into them I felt something strange on my right index finger which turned out to be the cap of a peanut can which was buried under a pile of paper garbage. A few seconds after that incident my finger started to bleed and my mom asked me if she should a get a plaster. I said 'no worries Mom it'll stop bleeding after a while :-)' but was in need for a bandage :D At least the cut is straight and clean, so the healing process won't take ages to complete :o</p>
