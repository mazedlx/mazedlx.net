title: Always Carry A City Map

                <p>I just got off the train, when a beautiful ebony woman asked me if I know where the British embassy is located. Silly me doesn't carry a city map of Vienna, nor do I know where the embassy is. After a few words of conversation I asked her if she knew any historic sites near it - she replied with the 'Belvedere Garden' - and I walk?  there every day when I go to work :-)</p>
