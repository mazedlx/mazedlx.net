                <p><img width="164" height="145" alt="L for Loser" id="image559" class="postimg" src="/uploads/l.jpg" />I saw the second L-Word episode yesterday and this show - aside from the sex scenes - has absolutely no special value for mankind. The story is lame and predictable, you just know what happens next before seeing it (like Neo from 'The Matrix'). Although there are some humorous scenes here and there, the show lacks of a brand new concept, like the one 'Sex &amp; the City' brought to us. And I'm so glad that the TV-Stations in Europe air those shows a few months after the premiere in the United States, so I get the chance to read all the spoilers ;-) And I've read them for 'The L-Word' from Season 1 to Season 3 and I'm very confident that it doesn't get any better. I've also read some comments to a newsfeed on the website of an Austrian newspaper, where lesbians wrote their opinion about the show (as the target group so to say), tenor is that they all like the show, it's more than a masturbation support for them and the problems of the lesbian community are discussed. Which problems that might be except from becoming pregnant and public acceptance?</p>
