                <p><img alt="PSP Giga Pack" id="image587" class="postimg" src="/uploads/pspgiga.png" />I've put my <a title="PS2 on eBay" href="http://cgi.ebay.at/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=8830881616&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT">PlayStation2</a> and my <a title="iPod on eBay" href="http://cgi.ebay.at/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=7631396488&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT">iPod</a> on eBay, and bought the Sony PSP Giga Pack on Amazon :-) So I need for gaming, listening to music and watching movies only one device, and that's the PSP. Furthermore the PSP features a neat remote control, which I missed from my iPod, and it has a larger screen. The only thing I'll miss is the large hard disk of the iPod,  the Memory Stick does not provide more than 4GB of storage at the moment (8GB are in development, and the new memory stick micro will have a capacity up to 32GB). The PSP has also got a webbrowser and wireless LAN. So I don't need to sit in front of my computer anymore to surf the web :-)</p>
