                <p><img width="165" height="165" alt="Bush Bomb" id="image592" class="postimg" src="/uploads/bush_bomb.png" />The helicopter of the Austrian ministry of the interior has been floating above my head for the whole morning now, because Mr. President is in town. I still wonder what his visit costs the public, but more than one million Euros would be a good forecast to our taxpayers. And I still can't imagine who either wants him or needs him here. Yesterday the police found four suitcases which supposed to be a bomb around his residence in Vienna, but non of them were armed. One of them had a sticker inside saying 'Gastgeschenk' - meaning 'present for the visitor' :-D</p>
