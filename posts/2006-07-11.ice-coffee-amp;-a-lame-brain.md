                <p><img class="postimg" id="image628" alt="Ice Coffee" src="/uploads/icecoffe.png" />Yesterday we decided to spend the rest of the evening in a cafe, supported by the fabulous weather. René, the waiter, dropped an ice coffee over some girls skirt - and we had our fun with that [René too I guess ;)]. Andi and I ordered an ice coffee too, and then the fun really started: René brought two glasses to our table - and dropped none of them. When I reached out for my glass with my left hand, my brain told my fingers to open up, and my fingers responded with 'Out of Order, Son'. I didn't really grab my ice coffee but gave it an uppercut and so I knocked it over to Andis shorts, who - Matrix-stylee - managed not to get that wet at all. After cleaning his shorts [thanks to C1RCA, for manufacturing shorts with lotus effect ;)], he knocked his already empty glass over. Those ice coffee glasses used at the 'Zum Siegl' cafe - after careful consideration - are not the best in ways of statics to be served :D</p>
