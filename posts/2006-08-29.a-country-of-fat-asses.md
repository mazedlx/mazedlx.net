                <p><img width="133" height="85" class="postimg" id="image701" alt="Fat" src="/uploads/fat.png" />Just read an article in some Austrian newspaper, that citizens of Austria are getting fatter all the time. A country full of fat asses, or in more medically words: more and more people who suffer from adiposity.</p>
<p>Adiposity and anorexia go hand in hand - at least on TV. On one side there are fat people that keep plundering ye olde food shoppe, and on the other side (mostly) girls with 40 kg (88 lbs), giving you a good look at their complete skeleton and that want to look just like that <a href="http://www.viply.de/?p=153">Nicole Ritchie</a>. Girls, believe me, us men want girls with ass and tits, not skull and bones ;)</p>
