<li>Your photoalbum is shiny lightblue and has a pink frame.</li>
<li>You think that beta is the only stage software ever gets.</li>
<li>You google.</li>
<li>You tag the content of your fridge with post-its, so you receive a shopping list in the form of a tag cloud.</li>
<li>You know what a tag cloud is.</li>
<li>You could make millions with your adsense account, but all of your website viewers got Adblock installed.</li>
<li>You digg. </li>
<li>When you like something you find it del.icio.us.</li>
<li>Before meeting new people you try to find their MySpace and Flickr profiles.</li>
<li>You change your last name from Miller to <span style="color: #0000FF#">Mill</span><span style="color: #FF00CC;">r</span>.</li>
<li>You would paint your national flag in Pink, Blue and Grey if you had the chance too. And equip it with reflections. And a beta star.</li>
