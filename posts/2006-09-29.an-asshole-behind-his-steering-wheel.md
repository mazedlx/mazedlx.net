                <p><img id="image754" src="/uploads/fuckoff.png" alt="fuckoff.png" class="postimg"/>When I got out of the tramway yesterday I was nearly hit by an asshole driver in his extremely gay Peugeot station wagon. And here is some information about the train station S&uuml;dbahnhof: when you step out of the tramway line D, you have to walk 1.5m on pavement, then cross two street lanes (one for busses and taxis and one for the rest), and then you're inside the main hall. There's also a traffic light, fifty metres in driving direction of the street mentioned above, and that traffic light happend to be red when I got out of the tramway yesterday. All the people crossed the street walking between the cars, so I decided in a &quot;Lemming&quot; kind of way to do the same, when that asshole I mentioned before whooped on the gas and tried to hit me. I screamed at him &quot;what the fuck is wrong with you asshole?&quot;. He just started to gesticulate trying to say &quot;how I can even think about walking across the street in front of his car while he has to wait for the traffic light to change from red to green&quot;. I screamed again &quot;I'm gonna punch you right in the face you fucking punk&quot;, then I turned away and walked to the train. Some Afro-Austrian citizen cursed the asshole in Swahili (or some other African slang) right after me. Next time something similar happens to me, I swear I'm gonna pull that guy out of his car and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kill him</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">punch him right in the face</span> start a clarifying conversation about his problems with me and the world :-)</p>
