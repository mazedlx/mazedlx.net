                <p><img id="image779" src="/uploads/noie.png" alt="noie.png" class="postimg"/>Wolfgang called my attention yesterday to a problem displaying my site in IE. Currently IE <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dies</span> stops loading after showing the preview picture of the first two mac ads, then two empty frames for the third mac ad and the first chad vader episode. I cannot certainly say why this happens, the page validates as XHTML1.1 and can be displayed in any other browser. IE7 also doesn't work. If possible use a different browser in the meantime. If not stay tuned until those pesky vids don't show up on the first page :D</p>
