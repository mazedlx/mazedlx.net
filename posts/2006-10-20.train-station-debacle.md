                <p><img id="image780" src="/uploads/oebb.png" alt="oebb.png" class="postimg"/><a href="http://www.toomaniac.com/maniac">Maniac</a> asked Schotti (who works for the Austrian Railroad - <a href="http://www.oebb.at">www.oebb.at</a>) if it is true that in 2007 or 2008, the main train station of Vienna - the S&uuml;dbahnhof is going to be renovated and therefore going to be closed - meaning that the tracks will end in Meidling. It is true that 60 to 70 percent of all passengers want to exit in Meidling, but those other 30 to 40 percent want to travel beyond. So this leads to the problem, that those 30 to 40 percent have to get out in Meidling, take the subway, tramway or bus, drive around S&uuml;dbahnhof, and then continue their daily pilgrimage to work or university. Independently from that conversation I witnessed at Wednesday's billard session, a good friend of mine, who I haven't seen in years, used the same train home yesterday as Sandra and I did, and asked me if it is true, that S&uuml;dbahnhof is going to be shut down completely. This is how rumors spread, and if you hear something you aren't sure about, from someone you haven't seen in the last 3 years, then it could be the bitter truth. I've absolutely no problem when it comes to travelling by foot, but the distance from Meidling to the soon to be refurbished S&uuml;dbahnhof is about five kilometres, which takes a normal human being 60 minutes. So this means that from the day on that Meidling will be the last stop, I've to get up one hour earlier to arrive at work at the same time as usual. But I could take the bus, or subway (but those 30 to 40 percent will too), and I would have to buy a monthly ticket again, which would cost me about 35 euros. Sandra still holds that the OeBB just can not shut down the entire train station, but judging from past failures I am very certain that I need to buy new shoes. I still remember that one day in January when it was just fucking cold, and the OeBB had recently rose their ticket prices just to serve free hot tea in the train stations for freezing passengers. Nice job, but it is not always that cold, I've never seen the OeBB squandering money for free cold beverages :)</p>
