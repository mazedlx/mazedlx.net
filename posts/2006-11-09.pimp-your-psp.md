                <p>You are the proud owner of a Sony PSP (like me) and you also own the Logitech Playgear Case (like me)? Then you should take a look on this almost 500 pages long thread on the official Playstation board all about <a href="http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=psp&thread.id=475432&view=by_date_ascending&page=491">Playgear skins</a>. My personal favourites is are the Prince of Persia skins made by EJ_Ink:
<a class="imagelink" href="/uploads/pop36nf.jpg" title="Prince Of Persia Skin By EJ_Ink"><img id="image803" src="/uploads/pop36nf.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Prince Of Persia Skin By EJ_Ink" /></a><a class="imagelink" href="/uploads/pop27dg.jpg" title="Prince Of Persia Skin By EJ_Ink"><img id="image802" src="/uploads/pop27dg.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Prince Of Persia Skin By EJ_Ink" /></a>
You'll also should find empty skins, so you can design your own one, but in case you're a lazy ass and don't want to search, you can also get it here:
