                <p><img id="image844" src="/uploads/srt.png" alt="srt.png" class="postimg" />Christmas time was always a time of piece, family and friendship - until yesterday: I saw a documentary on TV about the US double moral standards. I've never fancied what happened under the Bush administration, especially when it comes to marching in foreign countries and killing thousands of innocent people. And what intensifies my anger is, when stupid conservative politicans team up with even more stupid Christian fundamentalists.
And what is it what is pissing me off? It is <a href="http://www.silverringthing.com/">Silver Ring Thing</a>, a teen abstinence program helping teens not to get pregnant or contracting some sexual disease. And the only way to avoid getting pregnant or being infected simply is abstinence - at least that is what they're preaching. And to show the world, that they're not fucking around until they're married those kids wear a USD 15 silver ring. What the fuck is going on? I had sex before I got married, and I'm still having premartial sex. And why am I not the father of 6 children and how can it be that I don't suffer from syphilis or HIV? You already know it, because of some neat invention called 'the condom'. To stoke fears is much more easier than to tell the kids how life works.
There was this 12 yr old boy, who - in my opinion - doesn't even masturbate, but needs to wear that ring of abstinence. And as long as that ring doesn't feature an engraving saying 'one ring to rule them all...' it is utterly useless, by the way, the ring says 'true love waits'. For what? Sex is fun. You don't have to be married to do that. Driving a car also works without a driving license, but you should always wear a seatbelt - same thing with sex.
One 16 yr old girl was also interviewed. She said she wants to save her virginity to her husband whilst being the cheerleader's captain at her high school. Yeah, mhm, right. Backflipping around, almost stark naked, making the splits, showing her panty - she's almost the perfect nun.
And her husband will certainly be glad when it comes to the wedding night, and she is still a virgin with, let's say, 24 years of age, and doesn't know how to fuck. I'm may sound a little bit like an asshole, but trust me, no man wants to pop the cherry of a 24 yr old girl, obviously there must have been something gone completely wrong. At least that would be what I would think, when the girl of my dreams would tell me that she saved her virginity for her to-be husband, and needs to marry me before she could suck my dick. Experience should be gained when being young.
What is good for to wait? What if the husband just sucks when it comes to action? I would like to cite Bam Margera here</p>
<blockquote>When you buy a car, you first go for a test drive</blockquote>
<p>That's just right Bam, you say it! </p>
<p>I just don't get it how a country that has the largest porn market on the planet - and the known universe - can have laws that prohibit alcohol consumption in striptease clubs where the lap dancer gets completely naked while drinking beer is allowed if the lap dancer keeps her panty on? They're all like fuckign robots, never thinking about anything it seems. I know I have some US readers out there - not only from the US government - please reply using the comment function, I would love to know your opinion!</p>
<p>Besides the US government can kiss my ass, I don't give a fuck if I'm not allowed to enter your country, Canada is way better :-)
Sorry for the excessive use of the word 'fuck', but, fuck, I needed that!</p>
