                <p><img id="image892z" src="/uploads/imac.thumbnail.png" alt="imac.png" class="postimg"/>Due to the fact that my iMac got delivered yesterday, and I left work earlier than usual and everything works fine, I'm very proud to announce that I have now officially <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">been pimped</span> switched :-) The one and only problem I've encountered is that the wireless keyboard and wireless mighty mouse (both are connected via bluetooth) are interfering with the wireless tv signal I'm transferring from the TV in the livingroom to the TV in the bedroom, which in its case interferes with the wireless LAN signal when running on certain channels. This means that I've to figure out which WLAN channel doesn't interfere with the wireless TV signal and on which channel the wireless TV signal doesn't interfere with the bluetooth signals for mouse and keyboard :-) I wouldn't be surprised if I wake up one morning and finding myself lying there with an enormous brain tumor caused by all the 2.4GHz signals floating through our flat - and the neighbour's one too ;)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I would've posted some pictures of my iMac when unpacking it, setting it up etc. but unfortunately my camera's battery got flat at the time I connected it to the iMac. Those pictures should be released this afternoon or tomorrow morning.</span></p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
