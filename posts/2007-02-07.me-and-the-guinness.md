                <p><img src="/uploads/180px-guinness_2.jpg" alt="180px-guinness_2.jpg" class="postimg"/>I like beer. Not like Homer Simpson does, but I like it. And every once in a while I have myself a pint. Mostly when going out with friends or just to get drunk - I have to admit that these two things can be combined very easily.
I had my first Guinness back in 1996, at the age of fifteen. Just wanted to know how it tastes. To be true, it tastes awful. And it looks like a Coke that has been standing in the blazing sun, and then put in the fridge again. But it is that awful taste, that makes it worthwhile. And I have myself a Guinness once a decade. That it is enough.
The Guinness I had yesterday wasn't on tap but served in a can. And after I poured the beer in a glass, I recognised something trundling inside the can, but couldn't really see what it was, the yellow-grey foam obstructed my view. It then looked like an urinal cake (which I presume gives the Guinness its fine and balanced taste), the description of contents said that it is a 'floating widget'. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_%28beer%29">What the hell is a floating widget? It IS science!</a>.
Guinness is kind of magic, it doesn't taste good, it looks strange - but it wins your heart.</p>
