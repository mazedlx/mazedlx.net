                <p><img src='/uploads/dartboard.png' alt='dartboard.png' class="postimg"/>We have a dart board in our office. And sometimes I play darts. And when I take those darts in my hand and throw them towards the board, my brain disconnects from my arm, leaving the instructions what to do in place. I aim, I throw, I miss, I lose. But every once in a while I score points too, and all the more I lose then :-)</p>
