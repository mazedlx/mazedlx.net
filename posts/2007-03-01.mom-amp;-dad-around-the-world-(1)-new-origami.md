title: Mom &amp; Dad Around The World (1) / New Origami
tag: 
---


                <p>My Mom and Dad are going to start their trip around the world on Saturday, flying over to Japan, Fiji Islands, Australia and so on. And I hope that they'll bring me some Origami paper, because I'm despairing of folding those insects illustrated by <a href="http://www.langorigami.com/">Robert Lang</a>. My good friend maniac already folded almost all of them, using larger paper than me, but I just don't have the heart to ask him if he'd lend me some. By the way, 30x30cm suits me fine :)</p>
<p>I've already folded two new things:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href='/uploads/origami-2.jpg' title='Origami Heron'><img src='/uploads/origami-2.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Origami Heron' /> </a><a href='/uploads/origami-1.jpg' title='Origami Pelican'><img src='/uploads/origami-1.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Origami Pelican' /></a></div>
<p>And somehow I don't think they're folded tidily enough to be shown to the public ;-)</p>
