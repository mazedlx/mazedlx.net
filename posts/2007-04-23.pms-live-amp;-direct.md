                <p>Sandra asked me yesterday what I'd like to have for dinner, Spaghetti Carbonara or Risotto with Frutti di Mare, either one I'll get today and the other on tomorrow. So I said 'well I'd have the Spagehtti' and Sandra replied 'but there have to be mushrooms in the Carbonara sauce'. I said 'But I don't like mushrooms', and Sandra screamed, roared and whistled, and I left the building afterwards :-) And today she's totally nice and lovely :-)</p>
