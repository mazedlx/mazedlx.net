title: I Hate Those Greenpeace Guys

                <p>And it's their lucky day I do not carry a knife with me <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">all the time</span>. I'd gave a friend of mine some advice in PHP so I walked to his place starting at the train station in Wiener Neustadt. And when I walked out the main hall, cap on my head, ipod running, minding my own business, that damn Greenpeace son of a bitch walks right up in front of me and shouts 'hold it!'. Can you believe that? I replied with a simple 'Get lost!' and kept on walking. If I'd be a tank engine, that asshole shure'd be dead :-) But 5 minutes later the next Greenpeace activist sproutet out of the pavement and before I could react properly she'd left me alone. The look in my face must've been just right. I just can't understand how the hell those pesky morons do believe that I am the perfect victim for their campaign. I just don't get it. Would you ask someone who looks like he's eating kids for breakfast if he has the hearts for baby seals? Neither would I.</p>
