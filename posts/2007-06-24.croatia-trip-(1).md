                <p>Saturday &amp; Sunday:</p>
<p>Sandra and I arrived on Saturday in the afternoon in Umag at Hotel Sol Garden Istra. The hotel is huge, no really it is HUGE. Food and beverages are excellent, the hotel bar serves excellent Cuba Libres :-) On Saturday evening we decided to go to the center of Umag for some fruits, and to get there we used a tractor-pulled train. </p>
<p>The weather, food and beverages are excellent, the hotel bar serves excellent Cuba Libres. Croatian keyboards do suck, I have never seen that much special characters on a standard HP keyboard and I am still unable to find the apostrophe. Sandra already got tanned and I for myself look like a lobster. I would do good to stay in the shadow tomorrow, or the next few days ;-) </p>
