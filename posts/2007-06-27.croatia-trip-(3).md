                <p>Tuesday &amp; Wednesday:</p>
<p>The weather lost its warmth. It's actually not freezing  but temperatures round 20°C and rain clouds don't look like summer to me. Sandra snorted a small fly. And killed it instantly :-) Was good for a laugh too :-) There's is a slight problem with insects in Croatia, especially when lying in the shade of a tree. I had to kill about 1000 ants, two or three spiders and other liveforms, which I wasn't able to identify. Sandra shall forth be known as 'The Snort Killer' :))</p>
