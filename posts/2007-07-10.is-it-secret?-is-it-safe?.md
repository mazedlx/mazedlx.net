title: Is It Secret? Is It Safe?

                <p>Keeping passwords safe and secret is a task every user is concerned with. One may keep a passwort-protected spreadsheet, others use post-its and maybe you keep them in some very special application on your computer. I for myself, don't need spreadsheets, post-its or applications, just my head. Maybe it is not safe, but I use only one (1!) password for every account I own, including everything from website administration to ebay and email over to paypal and whatsoever. This reduces the overhead in remembering them but also increases the extent of damage. So, if someone finds out that very password, I'm literally fucked.</p>
