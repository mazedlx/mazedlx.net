                <p>It would have been spectacular if David Coulthard would have opened the all new motorway A6 located in Kittsee, 22 km of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">finest</span> Austrian tarmac, with a Red Bull formula one car. But the minister of transport, <a href="http://www.bmvit.gv.at/ministerium/faymann/wfaymann.html">Werner Faymann</a> said that it wouldn't be the right sign regarding transportation and environment. Furthermore he states that Austrian motorways are built for 130 km/h not 320. Well, that isn't exactly true. If Austrian motorways are only suitable for speeds lower than 130 km/h, then why can we buy cars that have a top speed  above 130 km/h? And one single racing car on a closed two-lane motorway should be no danger at all, even for speeds above 130. Faymann's environmental concerns is out of all reasons, one formula one car produces 1500 gramms of carbondioxide per kilometer, that is as much as nine normal cars would, or three of his staff cars. What will happen has still to be negotiated, Faymann's spokesperson said that Coulthard may open the A6, but only when he repsects the speed limit. What a country... </p>
