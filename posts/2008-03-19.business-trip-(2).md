                <p>I'm on my way home right now. It seems that meetings do not last that long anymore :-) Well, at least I had some fun before I entered the train station in Graz: some Greenpeace activist girl, dressed up in carnival clothes, unwashed, looking like the perfect bum, stood up in front of me, and screamed &quot;hiiiiii thereeeee&quot;, I - listening to Snoop Dogg at that time - responsed with &quot;oh my god&quot;, in the most contemptous way known to me. I think hear heart stopped beating after I passed her. Kill 'em all. </p>
