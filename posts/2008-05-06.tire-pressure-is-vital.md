                <p>Lucky me I didn't crash with my Bandit, always driving like my mom is driving with me, 1.5 bars per tire is not enough ;-)</p>
<p><span class="important">me: I think the tire pressure is too low</span></p>
<p><span class="note">René: Yeah, your tires seem to be a little bit flat since yesterday</span></p>
<p><span class="important">me: Thanks dude for immediately pointing that out to me.
</span></p>
