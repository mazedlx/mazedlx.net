                <p>Today we visited St. Tropez and St. Maxime, but we weren't able to find that very special Gendarmerie post where Louis de Funès once played &quot;le Gendarm de Saint Tropez&quot;. Back then St. Tropez was not more than a hicksville, today all the rich and famous meet and greet there. Sandra and my mom plundered Ye Olde Louis Vuitton Shoppe ;-)</p>
<p>Afterwards we continued our trip to Saint Maxime, where Jesus' girlfriend, Mary Magdalene is buried. It is told that it is her skull that is framed in gold.</p>
