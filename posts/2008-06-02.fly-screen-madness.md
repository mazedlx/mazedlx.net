                <p>Sandra and I went to the local hardware on Saturday store to buy fly screens, <a href="http://www.tesa.com/">Tesa</a> fly screens to be exact. Do not buy those! They suck ass! The duct tape won't stick to anything, except to the fly screen itself, the fly screen on the other side won't stick to the nub side of the duct tape, and the fly screen's edges aren't straight in any way. I should've read the customer reviews on Amazon before I poured my money down the drain. Bought new fly screens on Amazon the other day, only positive reviews with a Velcro like duct tape. Hope they do work.</p>
