title: Teeth Crumbling Away
tag:

                <p>One of my teeth decided to kill itself. The only one with an inlay. And now one fourth of it decided to break away while eating a chocolate bar. What's even more annoying is that it's Sunday, and the emergency medical service closes at 11:30 a.m. So I'll have to wait until Monday 6:45 a.m. And now I have a NOFX song in my head:</p>
