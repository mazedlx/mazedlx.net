title: Why I Don&#039;t Own A Shotgun

                <p>One of my teeth broke away yesterday, and today morning I paid the local teeth walk-in clinic a visit. At exactly 6:40a.m. I stood at the front desk - and got ignored. Five minutes later I was asked what my problem may be, and after explaining it, I was told to sit down. Ten minutes later I had my head x-rayed, and five minutes later I had it x-rayed again - the machine moved my head and so the x-ray picture got smudged. At 8:10a.m. I was called on and at 8:12a.m. I had a new appointment in my pocket: September 11th. Not being keen on running around with an interim solution in my mouth I'll call up my dentist tomorrow morning and ask her for an appointment for this or next week.</p>
<p>A shotgun probably could have saved me some time:</p>
