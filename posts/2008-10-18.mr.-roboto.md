                <p>At last: the robot suite for the average consumer. And it reminds me a bit of <a href="http://www.ea.com/crysis/home.jsp">Crysis</a>.</p>
<blockquote><span>Robot Suit HAL is a cyborg-type robot that can expand and improve physical capability.</span>

<span>When a person attempts to move, nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles via motoneuron, moving the musculoskeletal system as a consequence. At this moment, very weak biosignals can be detected on the surface of the skin. HAL catches these signals through a sensor attached on the skin of the wearer. Based on the signals obtained, the power unit is controlled to move the joint unitedly with the wearer's muscle movement, enabling to support the wearer's daily activities. This is what we call a 'voluntary control system' that provides movement interpreting the wearer's intention from the biosignals in advance of the actual movement. </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span>Not only a 'voluntary control system' HAL has, but also a 'robotic autonomous control system' that provides human-like movement based on a robotic system which integrally work together with the 'autonomous control system'. HAL is the world's first cyborg-type robot controlled by this unique Hybrid System.</span>

<span>HAL is expected to be applied in various fields such as rehabilitation support and physical training support in medical field, ADL support for disabled people, heavy labour support at factories, and rescue support at disaster sites, as well as in the entertainment field.</span></blockquote>
<p>The company that produces this suit calls itself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdyne_Systems">Cyberdyne - like in Terminator</a>. I wonder if there's a connection.</p>
