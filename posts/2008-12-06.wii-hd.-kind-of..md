                <p>The Wii is the only next-gen console that doesn't feature HD graphics. If you own a Full HD TV (like me) you'll find the Wii graphics a bit blurry, especially when playing games that feature advanced graphics. The solution is quite simple: a composite cable. I've found an article on <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/see-the-difference-wii-component-cables-make-28082.phtml">gamespot.com</a> which shows the quite remarkable difference between composite and component cable. And I can confirm the advancement, the picture is much clearer and sharper and more rich in detail.</p>
