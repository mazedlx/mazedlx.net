                <p>Until we meet again, which I'm very looking forward to, hold your head up high René, don't eat too much British food nor fall in love with one of the many sheep you'll meet in Wales. Try to stay somewhere where you can be online so we can talk over Skype or you can call for help. Cell reception isn't that good where you're going to stay. Those three months will be hard, for me as well as for you. I sincerely hope that your car won't break down on your way through Europe. And that you won't join any local rugby team - we both know how vulnerable you are to accidents, be it breaking your collarbone or  banging up your knee. If you must join any athletic event I'd recommend chess or scrabble. So long! Godspeed!</p>
