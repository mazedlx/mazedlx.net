                <p>I'm very glad to live in Austria. We have mountains, seas, cheap mobile rates and Red Bull. Red Bull is an Austrian company, famous for its self-titled energy drink and - since a few months -  for its Cola. Authorities in Germany have now tested Red Bull Cola positive on cocaine. It is now banned in six German states. The energy drink itself is already banned in Norway, Denmark and Uruguay.</p>
<p>Red Bull responded by saying the product is &quot;harmless&quot;, insisting the flavouring method using coca leaf extracts is widespread.They also commissioned its own test and said no cocaine was found.</p>
<p>So if any of you want some Red Bull, and live in a country where you'll get shot trying to buy one, you can contact me - I'll help you out :-) Free marketing anyone?</p>
