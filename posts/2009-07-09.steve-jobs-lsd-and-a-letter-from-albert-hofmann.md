                <p>I still wonder if Microsoft's own Steve Ballmer ever did drugs. Judging from his appearance I'd say: hell yeah.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5310549/lsd-creator-albert-hofmann-to-steve-jobs-how-was-lsd-useful-to-you">gizmodo.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Dear Mr. Steve Jobs,

Hello from Albert Hofmann. I understand from media accounts that you feel LSD helped you creatively in your development of Apple computers and your personal spiritual quest. I'm interested in learning more about how LSD was useful to you.

I'm writing now, shortly after my 101st birthday, to request that you support Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Peter Gasser's proposed study of LSD-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with anxiety associated with life-threatening illness. This will become the first LSD-assisted psychotherapy study in over 35 years.

I hope you will help in the transformation of my problem child into a wonder child.

Sincerely,

A. Hofmann</blockquote>
<blockquote>The letter itself isn't too illuminating; Hofmann was an incredible 101 years old at the time of writing, and merely mentions that he knew Jobs had mentioned LSD in a positive light in the press. Hofmann asks whether Jobs would like to contribute to an LSD-assisted psychotherapy study, and colorfully asks for Jobs's assistance in turning his "problem child" (Hofmann's pet name for LSD) into a "wonder child."</blockquote>
