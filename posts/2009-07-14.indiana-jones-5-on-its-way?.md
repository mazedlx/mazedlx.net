title: Indiana Jones 5 On Its Way?

                <p>Shia LaBeouf <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8102103.stm">gave an interview to the BBC</a>, and all but denied that there are plans for Indiana Jones 5. That's okay with me, as long as Indy won't get catapulted a few miles inside a fridge after a nuclear blast...</p>
