I'm currently working on a large Laravel project with about 1.900 tests. Unfortunately, running those tests in sequence takes about ten minutes,  and nobody has time for that. Fortunately, Laravel comes with a parallel test runner (https://github.com/paratestphp/paratest), which makes use of all available cores on your machine and cuts the time down to about 2:30 minutes. After I've written about 1.850 tests, running the whole suite sometimes resulted in tests failing. When running those failing tests, they're passing. I was stunned, not knowing where to start to fix this annoyance. Consulting the PHPUnit docs (https://phpunit.readthedocs.io), I came across the `processIsolation` attribute, which resides in the `phpunit.xml` configuration file. The documentation reads

> This attribute configures whether each test should be run in a separate PHP process for increased isolation.

```diff
- processIsolation="false"
+ processIsolation="true"
```

This simple change seems to fix my problem; now, all tests pass all the time.
