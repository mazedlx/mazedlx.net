                <p>I just read the Austrian news: a 41yr old Styrian goes on trial for attempted murder. He threatend a cop to throw a cobra on her. A shot in the femoral stopped him. What a freak! :-)</p>
<p>Throwing cobras is not a way to be nice to your pets! Remember that! That also applies to cats, dogs, froggies, fishies and whatsoever!</p>
