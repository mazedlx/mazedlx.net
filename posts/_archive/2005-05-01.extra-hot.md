                <p>Today we celebrated Sandra's birthday, and to do so, we went out for dinner to the Indien Village, a very fine Indian Restaurant in the heart of Vienna. I ate Murg Madras EXTRA hot. If you ever go out eating at an Indian restaurant, extra hot means extra hot :-) I'm used to eat very hot, so that wasn't an issue to me :-)</p>
