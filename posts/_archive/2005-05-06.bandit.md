                <p>Yesterday I rode my Bandit for the first time this year :-) Although the weather was a little unstable, I managed it not to drive in the rain - it stopped raining when I started the engine, and it started raining, when I stopped the engine - what a timing!
Today, the weather looks like winter or autumn, so no driving today. I hope the weather gets better on the weekend...</p>
