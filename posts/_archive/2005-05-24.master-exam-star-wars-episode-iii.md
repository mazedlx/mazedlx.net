                <p>Today I had my master exam and I passed :) Hooray for me! I was a nervous wreck before and totally relaxed after the exam which took me 75 minutes :) In the next days I'll keep celebrating my victory :)</p>
<p>Star Wars Episode III rocks, in case you watch it in English. The German version sucks :-P</p>
