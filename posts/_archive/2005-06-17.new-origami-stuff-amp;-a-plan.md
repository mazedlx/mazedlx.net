                <p>Added some new Origami Stuff in the nippon section and I'm very proud of my Level 1 Menger Sponge. I'm now thinking about building a Level 2 sponge, which will be built with 2400 sonobe units or a Level 3 sponge wich will be built with 66048 business cards. The folding and assembly will be a lot of work, so I'm calling for volunteers! Send your mail to christian dot leo at aon dot at :)</p>
