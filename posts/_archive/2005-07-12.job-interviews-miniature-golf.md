                <p>I had some interviews this week and also wrote more job application letters. Waiting sucks :-(</p>
<p>On Sunday Margit, Andi, Sandra and I played miniature golf in Payerbach. Sandra shot a fabolous hole-in-one on the second hole featuring a looping -?  impressive! After hole 10, Sandra lead the scoretable followed by Andi, me and Margit. Then, it started to rain heavily, so we had to make a coffee break :) After the 18th hole, Andi lead the scoreboard with 62 strokes, followed by me with 64, Sandra went 3rd place with 67 and Margit gained last place with 73 strokes. Man, I can hardly wait to play again :-)</p>
