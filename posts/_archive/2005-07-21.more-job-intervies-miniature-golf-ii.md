title: More Job Intervies / Miniature Golf II
tags:
---


                <p>Had some more job interviews this week and, unfortunately, received one rejection from a company in vienna. As they said to me, the reason for the rejection is the distance from my hometown to the company, and they fear that I won't have the stamina to travel the distance every day. Well, as far as I'm concerned, I don't think that this distance is an issue to me.</p>
<p>Today Andi, Margit, Sandra and I played miniature golf again. And Sandra?  shall be forth known as Miniature Golf Professional (abbreviated MGP), because of the performance she showed today. Sandra won with excellent 58 strokes, Andi came in second place with 62, Margit finished in third place with 63 strokes, and take a guess who finished last with an astounding score of 69 lousy strokes - yes, me. At least I can boast around that Sandra, MGP, is my girlfriend :-)</p>
