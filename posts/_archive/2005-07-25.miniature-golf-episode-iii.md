                <p>Today Margit, Andi, Sandra and I again pilgrimaged to Payerbach for another miniature golf session. Well, Sandra, MGP, scored another record with marvelous 46 strokes, including five (5) hole-in-ones. Andi finished in second place with 50, Margit came in 3rd with 55 strokes, and, you already know it, I finished in last position with not so lousy 57 strokes, which means a general improvement for everyone. Next time we'll play I fear that Sandra, MGP, will finish with a perfect 18-stroke-round. Until that day I'll have to work on my miniature golf skills :-) Man, I hate it to lose every time :-)</p>
