                <p>On Sunday Margit, Andi, Sandra and I played miniature golf in Payerbach again. An not just one round, we were motivated to replay the course a second time.</p>
<p>Here are the scores for Round I:
Andi: 54
Margit: 56
I: 60
Sandra: 62</p>
<p>And for Round II:
I: 47
Andi: 50
Sandra: 61</p>
<p>Margit: 71</p>
<p>The scores sum up for an overall 1st place for Andi with 104 strokes, me in 2nd place with 107, Sandra in 3rd place with 123 strokes, and Margit finished in 4th place with 125 strokes.</p>
<p>I think we'll downgrade Sandras title to MGE (miniature golf expert) :-)</p>
