                <p>Today I received my very own PC @ lomography.com. It's a HP, nothing special about that. It runs Windows XP SP2 :-P which wanted to know which language version of xp I want to have activated. I chose English, which wasn't a good idea, because, something got messed up during installation ...</p>
