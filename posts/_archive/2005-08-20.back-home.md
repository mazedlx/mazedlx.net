                <p>Sandra and I came home from Italy on Thursday, 2 days earlier as planned, because her Dad had to go to the hospital. He has a renali calculi which, it seems, won't come out the natural way ;-) The one and a half week were very relaxative and the weather was unlike to Austria, very hot and sunny. We got tanned, Sandra a little bit less than me, and I gained 2 kilogrammes of weight, which I lost in 2 days now.
My Dad started to renew the cladding of our house, and lucky me 'volunteered' to help him. In return he fixes my car, which needs new rear brakes, muffler, horn and rear suspension dampers.
The lomographic cameras paid off very well, i made over 250 pictures, which I gave Margit to develop negatives. I also made over 200 pictures with my digital camera. As soon as I get the lomographic pictures on cd I'll upload them to my LomoHome and announce it here.
I really need to take some time to play GTA San Andreas on my PS2, the last time I played was one month ago :-) These were the news so far.</p>
