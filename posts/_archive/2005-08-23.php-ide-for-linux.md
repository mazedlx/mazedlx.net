                <p>Seems like I found a PHP IDE that suits my needs, and it's called <a href="http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/">Quanta Plus</a>. Look and feel reminds me of <a href="http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-studio/">ZEND Studio</a> and it is open source software :-). Quanta features everything you want from a professional editor like autocompletion, syntax highlighting, automatic identation and so on. It's worth a look.</p>
