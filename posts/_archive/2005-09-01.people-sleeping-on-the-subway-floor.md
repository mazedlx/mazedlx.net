title: People Sleeping On The Subway Floor

                <p>I get to work by train/subway, nothing special about that, but when I entered the subway line 6 in vienna this morning at the Philadelphia Br√ºcke station, I saw something strange. A guy lay on the floor of the subway car, and at first I thought 'what the hell is happening, is he dead and why isn't anybody lifting a finger'. A split of a second later a woman from the subway supervision department entered the subway car and kneeled down beneath him, trying to wake him up. Astonishingly she succeeded?  and asked if it is comfortable to sleep on the floor. He said something like 'mhm' and 'blarb', stood up and acted like nothing ever happened. My advice: don't become an alcohol addict and take the subway simultaneously :-)</p>
