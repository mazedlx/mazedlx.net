                <p>At the subway station 'Philadelphia Br√ºcke' you'll be able to see all kind of devotees of various sects, for expample Jehova's Witnesses and Mormons. Speaking of Mormons, did you ever see the movie 'Orgazmo'? There's a very special scene where two Mormons approach a nice old lady in her garden:</p>
<p>Elder Young: We're from The Church of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Old Lady: Oh, Mormons.</p>
<p>Elder Young: That's right, I'm Elder Young, and this is Elder White.</p>
<p>Old Lady: Well, you boys can just fuck right off.</p>
<p>Elder Young: Ma'am?</p>
<p>Old Lady: You heard me. Take that book of Mormons and shove it so far up your righteous asses that you choke, you soul soliciting pigfuckers.</p>
<p>:-D</p>
