                <p>It's been 4 days now since I received my new mobile, so here's a short review for those of you who want to buy the same phone:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The camera is brilliant, autofocus works very well, and the pictures are very sharp, even when you use 4x digital zoom.</li>
    <li>The 32x digital zoom is a little bit disproportionate, because you can't see anything clearly at this magnification factor.</li>
    <li>The provided USB cable is used for file transfers an charging your phone when attached to an usb port.</li>
    <li>When connected to a PC the phone works as an external HDD (that is Linux, didn't try any other OS yet).</li>
    <li>Bluetooth and Infrared port work as expected.</li>
    <li>The camera light now features two instead of one white LED. A, in some cases, helpful gimmick is the SOS function, where the camera light flashes for help.</li>
    <li>Customization of the message alert has been added, which was missing in earlier mobiles from Sony Ericsson.</li>
    <li>The memory stick slot is placed sideways, which allows you to swap the memory stick all the time, not like Nokia's 6230 where you have to open the phone and take out the battery to access the memory card.</li>
    <li>Java Games run even faster now, brilliant graphics.</li>
    <li>Some new software like VideoDJ or PictureDJ where you can make your own movies and so on, have also been added.</li>
    <li>There is a new button where you can attach your shortcuts to.</li>
    <li>Now you see a status bar when deleting the calls list.</li>
    <li>Animated menus now serve as an eyecandy.</li>
    <li>No more annoying internet button</li>
    <li>The radio now features RDS and alternative frequencies (AF)</li>
    <li>And much more which I can't remember at this moment :-)</li>
</ul>
