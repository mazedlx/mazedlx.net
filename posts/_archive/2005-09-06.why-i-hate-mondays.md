<p>Everything went fine today, except the last 500 metres to the station in Neunkirchen, when the train decided to break down. I wasn't the only passenger that decided to get off the train and walk the last part to the parking lot. When we arrived there, we saw the not so defective train rolling in :-( We looked like lemmings walking beneath the rails :-D</p>
