                <p><a href="http://www.wana.at">Greuff</a> and Neo (PallidMask) asked me to 'sing' for their upcoming music project. We'll try to perform one song by <a href="http://www.sixfeetunder.com/">Six Feet Under</a> and <a href="http://marilynmanson.com/">Marilyn Manson</a>. The tryout event happens on Monday, September 12th, at 7 p.m. at the <a href="http://www.t-on.at">T-ON</a> rehearsal room. Hope my ears won't start to bleed ;-)</p>
