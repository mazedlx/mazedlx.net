                <p>Today I planed to go to work an hour earlier as usual (because i want to get home an hour earlier &#59;&#45;&#41;). I arrived at the train station in Neunkirchen and when I got out my car I saw a plethora of students waiting for the train. I said to myself 'No problem' because they all will exit in Wiener Neustadt which is the second stop after Neunkirchen, because all the schools and colleges are there.
So I entered the train, tried to get a standing room amongst those thousands of people, and when I checked for my wallet, I recognized that it was missing. It seemed that I forgot it in my car.
I don't want to be a fare dodger, so I got out the next stop 'St. Egyden' and called my mom, who is working in Neunkirchen. She laughed and picked me up 10 minutes later by car and brought me back to Neunkirchen. I picked up my wallet, and went to the platform #3 for the second time today. Lucky me the next train arrived in no time, so I boarded that one.
Five minutes later the train conductor announced that this train will end in Wiener Neustadt as an exception.
I thought 'damn, i got up one hour earlier today and will arrive at work at the same time as the usual'. Then, thanks to another happenstance, there was a train waiting on the opposed platform, so I boarded that one and came at least half of an hour earlier to vienna.
So, what have we learned? Never ever forget your wallet :-D</p>
