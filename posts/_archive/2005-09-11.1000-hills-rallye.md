                <p>Yesterday, Andi, Margit, Sandra and I took part as spectators at the final stages at the <a href="http://www.bpultimate-rallye.at">1000 Hills Rallye</a> located in <a href="http://www.aspangmarkt.at/">Aspang</a>, Lower Austria. The weather was very fine and the cars very fast, and one old lady and here even older husband got almost killed when they tried to cross the road before an approaching rallye car. Rallye cars are usually very loud, so those two had to be nearly deaf not even hearing one single sound ;-)</p>
