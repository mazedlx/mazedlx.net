                <p>On Friday Andi, Margit, Sandra and I contested another miniature golf round in Payerbach. I won with 56 strokes, Andi came second with 57, Margit finished third with 61 strokes, and Sandra, who is having a loss of form, finished with 75 strokes. Andi and I now can entitle ourselves with MGE (Miniature Golf Expert), the same title Sandra occupies :-)</p>
<p>The miniature golf season lasts till the end of September, so there is still enough time for a very last round this year ;-)</p>
