title: The Dead Cat Nobody Misses

                <p>Yesterday, when I walked from the subway station Sch√∂nbrunn to the Lomography office building, I saw a dead black cat lying on the road beneath the sidewalk. At closing time when I walked back to the subway station the dead cat 'moved' onto the sidewalk under a cardboard. And today it is still there. Isn't anybody missing that black cat? And who the hell lets his or her cat run around on the streets of vienna? :-( Poor black dead cat. Sandra said the cat sure looked like Bobby the Kitten:</p>
