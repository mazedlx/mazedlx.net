                <p>Yesterday, Margit, Andi, Sandra and I went to Salzburg to visit the <a href="http://www.hangar-7.com/mastersoforigami">Masters of Origami Exhibition</a> at <a href="http://www.hangar-7.com">Hangar 7</a>. The Origami shown was very impressive except from a few sculptures which I am also able to fold.</p>
<p>I shot two pictures which serve as puzzle pictures, titled 'Can you find My Crane at the Origami Exhibiton?':</p>

<p>After the exhibiton we drove to the center of Salzburg, to literally beef up ourselves and if the weather had not been that bad, we would even have done some seightseeing, but the rain and the temperature were horrible. We dined at the <a href="http://www.maredo.at">Maredo Steak House</a>. Andi was the only one who ever had heard something about Maredo in the past, so he took the lead, and led us in and me to the best steak I've ever had. 300 grammes of dead beef - simply delicious :-) If you are a veggie it's your own fault ;-)</p>
