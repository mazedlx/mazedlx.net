                <p><img class="postimg" alt="Jansport Rucksack" id="image124" src="/uploads/19092005.jpg" />I bought a new rucksack recently, and since it should last for at least 10 years, I decided for a <a href="http://www.jansport.com">JanSport</a>. The last one I bought, accompanied me since the early stages of the <a href="http://www.htlwrn.ac.at">HTL Wiener Neustadt</a> until the end of the <a href="http://www.fhwn.ac.at">FH Wiener Neustadt</a>. But time leaves marks, and I need more capacity. The Model I bought is called 'Airborne' coloured '003 Navy/Sea Blue/Black' and is part of the 'Air Lift 2.0' collection. It has a capayity of 36 litres and a weight of 1130 grammes, but see for yourself:</p>
