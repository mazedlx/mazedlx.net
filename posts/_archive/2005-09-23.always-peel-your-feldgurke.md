<p>Sandra had to puke yesterday (I hope she forgives me for writing this enry - I love you Sandra!) because she ate a cucumber that is kind of special in German speaking Europe, because I didn't find the correct translation for 'Feldgurke'. A normal cucumber (lat: Cucumus sativus) is shown in the top picture while a Feldgurke is shown in the bottom picture. The very special thing about Feldgurken is, that you normally peel them and take out the stones, before you eat them. Sandra said that it tasted a little weird - and then she puked :-) twice :-D Sandra, let this be a lesson to you!</p>
