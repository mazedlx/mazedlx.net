title: Sorry, We Have No Brakes
tags:

                <p>Yesterday's train conductor seemed to bery self-confident when he announced: 'Dear Passengers, because of technical problems concerning the brakes, we are 5 to 8 minutes off time. Thank you for your understanding'. What I found very interresting is that nobody screamed for help or asserted that we're all going to die. ;-)
I end this entry with a philosophical question: When the brakes aren't working, and the train can't break properly, then why aren't we faster, but quite the contrary 5 to 8 minutes too late? :-)</p>
