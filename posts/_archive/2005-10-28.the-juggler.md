                <p>I left the office today on 21:30 (I always work that long on Thursdays) and took the subway to the the train station. When I arrived at the platform in Wien Meidling, I saw a guy juggling with five balls at the same time. I watched him for a while before I started a small conversation about juggling, and that I'm able to juggle 3 balls, but 5 seems to be outstanding. I made a picture while he was juggling  with 5 balls, you can see it in the SHOTS section. Juggling always reminds me of my good friend Wogri, who is also a juggling expert, and once piggybackrode me at the <a href="http://www.fhwn.ac.at">FH WN</a>, so I fell to the floor and crushed my knee into the ground :-)</p>
