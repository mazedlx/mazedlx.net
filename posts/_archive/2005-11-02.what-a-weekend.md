title: What A Weekend

                <p>This weekend was so turbulent:
On Friday the USB backup disk frame of the databaseserver at work died, I fixed that today.</p>
<p>On Sunday I decided to join a LAN session at a friends house on Tuesday, so I installed a HDD frame, and when I had loosen the last screw of my HDD, it fell down and my fine working ubuntu was gone.</p>
<p>On Monday I decided to buy a new 200 GB HDD, which my BIOS won't recognize.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I played Battlefield 1942 at the LAN session, Battlefield 2 didn't work because of my lame ATI RADEON 9000 graphic card.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I reinstalled ubuntu on the HDD which fell down, and it worked. Something stranged must have happened during the 30 cm fall :-).
By the way, I used Windows XP to play Battlefield, so I came to the decision to sell my 200 GB HDD via eBay, buy another 80 GB HDD, to install Windows (just for gaming purposes), and buy a new graphic card.</p>
<p>At the end I've learned that dropping HDDs isn't good in any way, Ubuntu is an operating system, Windows is a joke, ASUS mainboards suck, and that 64MB graphic cards aren't suitable for LAN sessions.</p>
