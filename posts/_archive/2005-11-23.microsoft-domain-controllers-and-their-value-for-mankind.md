                <p>If you ever encounter profile related problems in your windows network which is also a domain at the same time, try this:</p>
<p>unplug the network cable</p>
<p>log on to the domain</p>
<p>log off</p>
<p>shutdown</p>
<p>plug in the network cable again</p>
<p>restart</p>
<p>log on</p>
<p>This is what I did today on three client machines after restarting the domain controller, which was up for 7 weeks now :-)</p>
<p>By the way: <a href="http://www.wogri.at">Wogri</a> seems to win the movie competition, thanks for all your support, and keep on voting until the competition is over! :)</p>
