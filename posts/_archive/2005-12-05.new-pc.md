                <p>On Friday I bought a new PC. It features a AMD Venice 3200+ CPU, GeForce 6600GT GPU, Asus A8V Deluxe Mainboard, 1GB RAM, a Zalman CPU Cooler, and last but not least an Arctic Cooling GPU Cooler (which doesn't fit on my graphic card, I'll exchange that part today).
First of all I would like to thank <a href="http://toomaniac.com">maniac</a> and Kopi wo helped me out for being such a noob :-) I assembled the PC, and it wouldn't boot -&gt; always RTFM! Now everything works fine (and fast and silent), can't wait until Thursday when Andi and I start our very private LAN Session :-)</p>
