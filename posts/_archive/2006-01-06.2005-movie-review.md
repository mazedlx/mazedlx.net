                <p>2005 is gone, and it's time to present a list of the movies I've seen in the past year - and of course my very personal ratings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith (on May 21st): A</li>
    <li>Sahara (on June 26th): B-</li>
    <li>War Of Worlds (on July 3rd): B</li>
    <li>Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy (on July 12th): B+</li>
    <li>Madagascar (on July 16th): A</li>
    <li>Fantastic Fout (on July 23rd): C+</li>
    <li>Mr. & Mrs. Smith (on July 27th): A-</li>
    <li>Sin City (on August 26th): A-</li>
    <li>Red Eye (on September 23rd): B-</li>
    <li>Nochnoi Dazor (on October 1st): A-</li>
    <li>The Dukes Of Hazard (on October 22nd): B+</li>
    <li>Doom (on November 5th): D</li>
    <li>The Chronicles Of Narnia: The King Of Narnia (on December 12th): E</li>
    <li>King Kong (on December 26th): C+</li>
</ul>
<p>And many other Movies from which I didn't kept the theatre ticket, so I can't post them :) But judging from the movies that are listed above, that Narnia pile of shit was the worst movie I've seen in 2005, followed by Doom (although that one was fun too) and King Kong. The top movies where Madagascar and Star Wars Episode III, followed by Sin City and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith.</p>
