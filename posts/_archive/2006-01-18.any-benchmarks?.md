title: Any Benchmarks?
tags:

                <p><a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> recently launched their new MacBook Pro which features an Intel Core Duo processor. Apple states that this notebook is four times faster than the old PowerBook with G4 processor. Sounds interesting, but I didn't find any benchmark tests that are independent from apple. This is like saying &quot;my dick is bigger than yours&quot; without proof ;-)</p>
