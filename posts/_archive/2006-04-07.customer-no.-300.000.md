                <p>Yesterday I received my prize, which I won for being the 300.000th customer of <a href="http://www.chello.at">Chello</a>. Chello is my ISP, and they gave me a voucher for a flight for two to an <a href="http://www.upc.at">UPC</a> country of my choice. Sandra and I will fly to Ireland. Besides of the flight tickets, we were taken by helicopter to a very fine restaurant: the <a href="http://www.blaue-gans.at/">Blaue Gans</a> in Weiden/See.
