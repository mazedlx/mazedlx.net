                <p>Or not to be, was a question I didn't want to answer in public (in my blog). But today should be the first day I share my opinions with the world. And I'll start with phenomenon (not only) in Europe, called 'Ehrenmord' (could be compared to murder for honour).</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="http://www.kurier.at/chronik/1337545.php">kurier.at</a> (second biggest newspaper in Austria), a young Turk has been condemned to 9 years and 3 months of jail, for killing his sister with 3 shots in the head. The reason why he killed her: His sister was forced to marry her cousin back in Turkey, she got pregnant, and refused to come back to Turkey, moved out from home, and began an apprenticeship as an electrician. The new lifestyle of the young girl dissatisfied the family so much, that her brother was told to kill her.</p>
<p>Those murders are no sole exceptions, they happen every day all over the world. And there are enough countries where such murder is tolerated and accepted by the public. So what to do? <a href="http://www.serap-cileli.de/">Serap Cileli</a> is good point to start at.</p>
