                <p>The president of the United States of America (and one of the biggest terrorists on this planet) Mr. George W. Bush is coming to Austria in June. Demonstrations and an immense police platoon will lead the way from Vienna International Airport to the inner city. And I can't imagine what he wants here and what is so important as it has to be told to our government</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned that dickhead should stay at home and keep on pretending to be the chosen one to bring peace to the earth.</p>
