                <p><img class="postimg" id="image529" alt="Goleo" src="/uploads/goleo1.jpg" />As I've just read online, the mascot of the 2006 soccer world championship, known as Goleo or the lion without pants and his gay friend Pille are about to ruin the soft toy company <a href="http://www.nici.de/cms/de/">Nici</a>. Nobody wants to buy him, and Nici reckoned with a multi-million sale of Goleo. In fact, the pantless lion is as popular as a pulled muscle :-D</p>
