                <p>Sandra will have her final written exams on Monday and Tuesday, and she is nervous (and learning) all the time. If I had learned with her enthusiasm I would have passed the University?  for Applied Science with a big fat super triple A+ graduation :-D . Sandra, I feel very confident that you'll pass those exams with a fabulous grade! So try to kind of relax this weekend, an not to kill yourself with learning stuff that you already know! I love you!</p>
