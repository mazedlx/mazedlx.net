                <p>I'll keep my fingers crossed today and tomorrow from 9a.m. to 1p.m, because of Sandras final exams. May the force be with you!<br />
Yesterday <a href="http://toomaniac.com">maniac</a> and I joined forces for a motorbike ride. And guess what - the weather sucked, as always when I decide to go for a ride :p At least we didn't get that wet in the rain and had the chance to fill our tanks with supreme gas :-D
