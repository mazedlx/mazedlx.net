                <p><img class="postimg" title="The L-Word Crew" id="image527" alt="The L-Word Crew" src="/uploads/l-word-1.jpg" /> On Tuesday I saw the first episode of 'the L word' on TV. The teasers and trailers made it a bit more interesting for me, so I sat there from 10:15pm to 11:15pm [including commercial breaks every 5 minutes ;-)] and enjoyed 'Sex &amp; the City' gone homosexual.</p>
<p>At least the sex scenes seem to be a little bit more enthusiastic than in SITC, especially when girl kisses girl, but I expected too much when I thought of 'the l word' being a lesbian porno like 'where the boys aren't' and the like but legal (for viewers of under 18 years of age that is). The next episode will be sent out on Tuesday next week, and the teaser already revealed the top five scenes, but maybe it's worth watching too...</p>
