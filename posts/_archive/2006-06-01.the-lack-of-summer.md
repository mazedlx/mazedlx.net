                <p>Today is the 1st of June, meaning that there should be some warm temperatures coming up - well it seems that we've missed summer here in Austria, because of the fan heater that is running behind my desk - temperatures below 15°C are the reason for cold fingerswhisdojzlkjsdaf, oops I mean which aren't able to type anything on the keyboard :-D</p>
<p>I hope I can take my Bandit out for a ride this long weekend, otherwise I will move to Sicily. The temperatures there are between 11°C in January and 40°C in July, while in Austria the temperatures rech from -40°C to +30°C.</p>
<p>I don't want to moan about the weather every day - but it sucks incredibly :-)</p>
