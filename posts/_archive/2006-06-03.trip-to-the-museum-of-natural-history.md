                <p><img width="181" height="241" class="postimg" id="image552" alt="Me at the NHM" src="/uploads/DSC00107.JPG" />Sandra and I visited the <a href="http://www.nhm-wien.ac.at">Museum of Natural History</a> in Vienna today. Was a nice trip, but I like animals more alive than preserverd in alcohol :-) We also had dinner in a vietnamese restaurant. And furthermore we dropped by at a starbucks caf√© for a frappucino (and a muffin too).</p>
