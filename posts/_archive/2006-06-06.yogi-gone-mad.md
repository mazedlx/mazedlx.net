                <p><img width="233" height="222" alt="Yogi Bear" id="image557" class="postimg" src="/uploads/5f19_homer_baer.jpg" />There has been a lot of stories written in European newspapers and websites in the last weeks about the 200 kg (450 lbs) brown bear 'JJ1' or - like the public calls him -  'Bruno the (Killer) Bear'. Since the 10th of May 2006 he killed more than 20 sheep, 11 chicken and destroyed two bee sheds.</p>
<p>What I find very interesting is, that the environment secretary of Bavaria, Germany declared the bear 'as very welcome' on May 18th, and 4 days later as 'a problem bear' who's gone completely bonkous and should be shot :-)
The mood in Austria is slightly different, because Bruno must no be shot but should be dazed, catched and brought back to normality - maybe with a rehabilitation programm or with a stay at a boot camp :-)
Meanwhile the bear has passed the alps [faster than Hannibal ;-)], coming from South Tyrol, and it seems that it's impossible to catch him red-handed. Yogi would be proud of Bruno - who seems smarter than the average bear :-D</p>
