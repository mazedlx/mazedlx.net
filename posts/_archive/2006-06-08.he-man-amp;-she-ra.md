                <p><img width="218" height="339" alt="He-Man & She-Ra" id="image561" class="postimg" src="/uploads/standing.gif" />I don't how my friends and I hit on this topic at our weekly pool round yesterday but as far as I can remember we had a lot to laugh about. Anyone of us born in the 80s should know about He-Man and She-Ra, if not, here are some fact about them:</p>
<p>Prince Adam and his twin sister Princess Adora are the alter egos of He-Man and She-Ra. Adam and Adora look like everyday peers until they raise their swords which they got from the witch of Castle Grayskull, they would transform into He-Man and She-Ra. Those siblings are members of the good fraction. The other side consists of Skeletor and his bunch of bad guys. And as usual they're fighting against each other - the classical good vs evil.</p>
<p>The plethora of chracters are called 'Masters of the Universe' - a very successful toy series from <a href="http://www.mattel.com">Mattel</a>. They created She-Ra to bring the world of He-Man to girls, and equipped her with a white horse and a bunch of female friends.</p>
<p>I still can remember playing with those toys back in the early 80s when a good friend of mine was in possesion of some of the figures. He had He-Man and his animal companion Battle Cat (a Tiger), Skeletor, Moss-Man, Stinkor, Hordak (who is Skeletors tutor) and maybe some more too which I can't remember ;-). There were also a cartoon series of both of He-Man and She-Ra episodes, which were aired from 1988 to 1992 on TV.</p>
<p>And I had a picture of She-Ra in my head yesterday that she looked like He-Man in a skirt, but thank god she didn't take her anabolics :-D And as usual good wins against evil, mostly because of high ranked evil guys delegate work to pointy-headed subalterns who always mess up things.</p>
<p>By the power of Grayskull!</p>
