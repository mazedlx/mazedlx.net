                <p><img alt="iTunes Icon" id="image568" class="postimg" src="/uploads/ITunes_Icon.png" />I've installed the very new <a title="Ubuntu Linux" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> version on my other HDD the other day, and I must say that it's just perfect out-of-the-box. I also installed the XGL/Compiz packages for superb 3D-Desktop enhancements. But I use Windows XP most of the time because of CounterStrike Source, Battlefield 2 and <a title="iTunes" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a>. I could live with playing CSS under Linux but I'm still waiting for Apple to release an iTunes Version for Linux systems, and I don't think that it is a matter of programming difficulties but the lack of market. So here's my call to Apple:</p>
<p><strong>Please port iTunes to Linux! I'm in a desperate need for an application that corresponends with my iPod in an appropriate way!
</strong></p>
<p>One once said: &quot;Linux is for working, Windows is for Solitaire&quot; was right, because I switched from Windows to Linux once and didn't miss anything, except those things we all hate about using Microsoft products.</p>
<p>I know that there are solutions for my problem, e.g. CrossOverOffice, but I want a more native solution.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'll try to bring <a title="iPodLinux" href="http://ipodlinuxinstl.sourceforge.net/">iPodLinux</a> to my iPod today :-)</p>
