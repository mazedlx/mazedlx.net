                <p><img alt="iPodLinux" id="image569" class="postimg" src="/uploads/ipodlinux.png" />I've installed <a title="iPodLinux" href="http://ipodlinux.org">iPodLinux </a>and <a title="rockbox" href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a> on my iPod today and those two are pretty neat gadgets that can be used instead of the Apple OS running on iPods. The <a title="Open Up My Eager Eyes - Multi Boot Your iPod The Easy Way" href="http://foxmajik.livejournal.com/480621.html">installation is quite simple</a>, but make sure to read the instructions very carefully! And what is it good for?  Rockbox is an open source replacement firmware for mp3 players and iPodLinux is an  open source venture into porting Linux onto the iPod. Providing the ability to play Doom (iDoom) on your iPod and a bunch of other games as well, and being more functional and efficient at the same time, they're a good replacement for the original Apple firmware.</p>
