                <p><img class="postimg" id="image579" alt="iPod Dock" src="/uploads/ipodanddock.png" />If you have ever wondered which people have enough money to spend on an original iPod dock, <a title="iPod Dock made from an Altoid Can" href="http://forums.ipodhacks.com/showthread.php?t=2275">those people don't</a>. All you need is an Altoids can (or any other can you prefer), glue, a gripper, and a little bit of time. And voil√°, your very own custom made iPod dock is finished :-) You could also use <a title="iPod Dock Toiletpaper Rolls" href="http://www.mug-bs.de/2005/04/selbstgebautes_ipoddock.html#more">this guide for building your own dock</a>. An old <a title="Cassette Tray iPod Dock" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47718017@N00/sets/72057594128669242/">cassette tray</a> is also adequate to serve as and iPod dock and an jewel case for your iPod at the same time  - invented by <a title="thinkmo's flickr profile" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47718017@N00/">thinkmo</a>. And finally, if you own some Lego stones, how about trying <a title="Lego iPod Dock" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxmatt/92390396/">this one</a> from <a title="linuxmatt's flickr profile" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxmatt/">linuxmatt</a> :-D</p>
