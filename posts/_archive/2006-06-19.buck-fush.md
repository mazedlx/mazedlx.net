                <p><img alt="GW Bush" id="image585" class="postimg" src="/uploads/bush.png" />Mr. President is coming to Austria tomorrow which leads to the following situation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>From Tuesday 07:00 untill Wednesday 24:00 the area around the Intercontinental Hotel is inacessible for public.</li>
    <li>More than 3000 policemen and 200 members of the Austrian SWAT team 'Cobra' will be in use.</li>
    <li>All pubs, restaurants and shops around the Intercontinental will be closed for Bush's stay.</li>
    <li>Those pubs, restaurants and shops won't get any compensation to their loss of sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gunnery Sergeant Hartman used to say: 'Only steers &amp; queers are from Texas' , and Texas is the place Mr. President should stay :-D</p>
