                <p><img class="postimg" id="image597" alt="eBay" src="/uploads/ebay.png" />Some 'Mrs. Migret' contacted me via eBay regarding my PlayStation2, asking me if it is possible that I send it to Nigeria, because her son lives there (inserted via copy &amp; paste):</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hello Seller how are you doing. </em></p>
<p><em>i am mrs migret from london. i in need bying this specia item as a present for my son in nigeria. send me the cost of shipping to nigeria. and the cost of item. i will been paying for this item via bank transfer. send me your bank data so that i can transfer the total money to youe account. thanks i wait to hear from you very soon. </em></p>
<p><em>Best Regard...Mrs Migret&quot;</em></p>
<p>Regardless of what you might think about her command of English [and mine  ;-)], I wrote her the following statement as a reply:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hi Mrs. Migret! </em></p>
<p><em>Due to the fact that my Playstation2 has been sold in Europe I can't guarantee you that it will work properly with the Nigerian TV and Electricity Standards. Nevertheless the shipping to Nigeria would cost about 30 Euros from Austria (without package insurance), and I'm not aware of the Nigerian way for packages from Europe through customs. This could also cost extra. I think it would be much easier to ship the package to London, of course I cannot assure you that my Playstation2 is compatible with the British TV &amp; Electricity standards.</em></p>
<p><em>Regards, Christian Leo&quot;.</em></p>
<p>That Mrs. Migret is - as I found out via eBay - from California, USA, and a short while after replying to her question, I received an email from eBay telling me that it is 'unsafe' to sell products outside the eBay marketspace and so on. Thanks eBay for that information - bad people everywhere ;-)</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned that package will never reach Nigeria, because I already got some bids on the article, and I'm therefore not allowed to sell it to other people. And buying stuff via eBay and send it to Nigeria doesn't pay off because of customs and shipping costs and package insurance and any other extra costs. So shipping would cost as much as the package's content.</p>
<p>Sorry Mrs. Migret, how about buying stuff in Nigeria? I think that would be a lot more easier and cheaper :-)</p>
