                <p><img alt="Dead Yogi" id="image601" class="postimg" src="/uploads/yogidead.png" />Very sad news arrived me today: Bruno the Brown Bear aka 'JJ1' has been shot today morning at 4:50. Although his reprieve should last until today, some hunter killed the bear which seemed 'abnormal' in Bavaria, Germany. So long Bruno, rest in peace :-( We will miss you and how you tricked all those people that wanted your death instantly, and those special bear-searching dogs from Finland, which hadn't any chance against your stealth-like hide and seek tactic! Hope you have it better now wherever you are!</p>
