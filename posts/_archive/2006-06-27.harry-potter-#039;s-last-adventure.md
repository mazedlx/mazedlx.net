                <p><img class="postimg" id="image606" alt="Harry, Hermione and Ron" src="/uploads/harrypooter.png" />I've just read that J.K. Rowling is about letting 2 characters die in the final book of the Harry Potter sequel. For me it seems that she had to do that because of some special reason, although she said she wrote the ending 15 years ago, when nobody gave a fuck about the Wizard of Hogwarts and his friends. I think that 'they're all going to die'-finale is coming because of Harry, Hermione and Ron are going to hit puberty. Ron will suffer of huge spots all over his face and when Harry asks Hermione if she wants to see his 'magic stick', things wont be suitable for children anymore :-D</p>
