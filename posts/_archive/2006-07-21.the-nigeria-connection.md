                <p><img alt="419 Fraud" id="image641" class="postimg" src="/uploads/nigeria-connection.png" />I recently posted that some Mrs. Migret wrote me an email via eBay. That Mrs. Migret contacted me again telling me the following:</p>
<p>Her son died in an accident in Nigeria, and he has got 45 million USD on his banking account, which she wants to share with me if I send her my account data.</p>
<p>My reply to that email was as simple as <em>FUCK OFF</em>. How dumb someone has to be to fall for that kind of offer? Not as dumb as you might think.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, those people from the 'Nigeria Connection' (<a title="The 419 Fraud" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_fraud"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_fraud">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_fraud</a></a>) are active since almost 15 years now, and I'm very sure that they've made a great deal of money already.</p>
<p><a title="http://toomaniac.com" href="http://toomaniac.com">Maniac</a> asked me to sell his mobile phone via ebay. So I made an advert and put it online. A day later the mobile was sold to a girl in Spain, who asked me in an inscrutable English to give her my banking account number so she can send me the money. 3 weeks passed and I didn't had any spanish Euros on my account when I wrote her a second email telling her that I haven't received any money yet, and I'll sell the phone on eBay again. She replied, telling me that she once lost money when she bought a notebook on eBay, transferred the money and didn't get any goods. I've told her that I never betrayed my customers on eBay and that I am a trustworthy person.</p>
<p>Well, I put the ad online once again. And a non english-speaking English guy bought the mobile. And asked me if it was possible to send the phone to Italy where a friend of him lives. Normally this shoud have raised the alarm bells in my head - same procedure as that Mrs. Migret, but other country of destination - but it didn't.</p>
<p>I received an email from an English Trust Bank which told me, that my money is on hold and they're waiting for a proof of shipment. And then I became the buck passer when forwarding the email to Maniac, because of it is his mobile and his money.</p>
<p>He boxed and shipped the phone and 3 nanoseconds later we found out that pius_wilson, who bought it, was a so to say member of the 'Nigeria Connection'. Too late for the Austrian postal service. A package mailed is a package unstoppable. I wonder what would happen if someone mailed a bomb and decided that it was a big mistake ...</p>
<p>No success with the Austrian postal service, but what if someone informed the Italian postal service. Maniac doesn't speak Italian, neither do I, but my mom does. So she called in, an no results as of today.</p>
<p>Everything looked quite real to Maniac &amp; me, but for the future here are some guidelines not to fall for those bloody bastards:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Never trust anyone who uses a trust service which is not approved by eBay.</li>
    <li>Never click on any links in emails you received from those assholes, nor do log in there and the like.</li>
    <li>Inform eBay about the frauding member and give him a negative evaluation, so other eBayers don't fall for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should've done that, at least I won't do the same mistake a second time - and Maniac won't ever sell on eBay again, because that was the second time someone took him to the cleaners :D</p>
