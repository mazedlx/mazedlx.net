                <p><img class="postimg" alt="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" id="image647" src="/uploads/tmnt.png" />I've just came across <a title="TMNT Trailer" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/teenagemutantninjaturtles/hd/">the trailer for TNMT</a> on <a title="Apple Movie Trailers" href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">Apple's Movie Trailer Site</a>. That must've been the late eighties to the early nineties when those rat-tutored mansized turtles fought against the evil: Shredder, Krang, Rocksteady &amp; Bebop. I hope that this completly animated movie is the excuse for the two lameass movies which were released in 1990 and 1991. The movies really sucked, like most comic-to-movie productions did then (Batman, Superman, Supergirl, and the like). I hope the executive producers for those burn in hell by now :D</p>
<p>I remember having one of those turtles from some toy company, I think it was Donatello, the one with the Bo. Leonardo had the swords, Michelangelo the nunchaku, and Raphael fought with the Sai forks. Then there was this yellow overall wearing news reporter April, and Sensai Splinter, the wise rat :)</p>
