<div align="left">We came home from Italy on Saturday, after a terrible twelve-hour-car-journey caused by a massive traffic jam between Venice end-of-highway-A13 and beginning-of-highway-A4. Those 10 km took us at least two hours. If Andi and I were able to hold the speed at all times we would have been at home by 1 p.m., but we weren't so we got out of the car at 5:30 p.m.</div>
<p>The weather was (except for one day) beautiful, the water was warm, and totally algae and jellyfish free in contrary to what every newspaper reported: coasts infested with zillions of jellyfishs and tons of algae, making it impossible for you to swim.</p>
<p>The accomodation we did rent for that one week was huge, except for the bathrooms (yes we had two). Those zones of refreshment and easement where that small, we had to get in with the help of a shoehorn and out with a handgrenade.</p>
<p>We had plenty of food and wine - so all of us gained a little weight. Andi and I got tanned like gladiators, Margit a little bit less, and Sandra - well Sandra has her own kind of tanning (sorry for that - I love you).</p>
<p>The temperatures were mostly over 35Â°C, and the sand at the beach was at least as double as hot - we were well advised to wear sandals outside of the shade. Lucky us, the &quot;Squishy-Tank&quot; arrvied and provided us with ice cold drinks and ice-cream.</p>

<p>At the beach there was that one cop driving a quad and being an Chief-Wiggum-Look-A-Like</p>

<p>On one day we went to San Vincenzo, to dine, and what was more important for Sandra, to buy a new Murano glass ring. The last one she got from me in San Vincenzo was destroyed a few months ago at home, it just did break - glass is sharp and she did bleed a little. Sandra is smart and did let me buy her two rings this time - one in reserve so to say - she dropped one on Thursday, and the second one on Saturday. Lucky her, those rings can also be bought online.</p>
<p>After dinner in San Vincenzo we went for a walk, a gelati and for some shopping, when out of a sudden some loud heavy metal music filled the air. First we thought of a band, then we saw him: the Ghettoblasterguy. He looked like Ozzy Osbourne in earlier days, volume at 10, cigarette in his mouth, angry glance on his face, and walked straightway down the pedestrian area. Ten minutes later back again, and another ten minutes again the other direction. We just couldn't figure out what the hell this guy was up to.</p>
<p>Then, in the window display of the 'Gardenhouse' shop (like Ikea, only more luxuriously), we saw it: The Grillum Romanum. George Foreman's Grilling Machine for Gladiators, with the weight of a compact car and the price too.</p>
<p>Andi and I also constructed an impressive sandcastle, which stood against the floods for some time. Lucky us, Margit and Sandra took some pictures.</p>

<p>That one day the weather sucked we decided to take a trip to Livorno, via some coast road.</p>

<p>Then in Livorno we saw the Uber-Yacht, and some Pakistani warship. That yacht had second smaller yacht, as kind of a jollyboat. Compared to what you and me see when we hear warship that Pakistani one was more like a Greenpeace-is-trying-to-stop-a-whaling-ship-boat.</p>

<p>Finally I would like to thank my friens at the 'La Ribotta' in Castagneto Carducci for serving the best Italian food at all times, grazie mille.</p>
