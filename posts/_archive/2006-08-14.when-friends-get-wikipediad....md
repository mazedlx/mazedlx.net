title: When Friends Get Wikipediad...

                <p><img class="postimg" id="image679" alt="Wikipedia" src="/uploads/wikipedia.png" />... and you don't. A friend of mine wrote an email today that he is now immortal, thanks to the fact that <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:SB_109-13_%26_SB_109-109.JPG">a picture of him appears on wikipedia</a> (he's the guy on the right side), showing him, some other guy and a steamengine train :) I could get wikipediad myself, by writing an article about my site, but it seems much more exciting when someone else writes an article about something where you'll appear for eternity ;)</p>
