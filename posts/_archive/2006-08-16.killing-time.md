                <p><img class="postimg" id="image684" alt="Brat" src="/uploads/brat.png" />I have an otitis externa dexter - meaning my right ear is cankerous. I've already visited the clinic three times, and it is getting better now. Besides of an immense healing progress, I also experienced the way of waiting - today 2 and a half hours long. I always wonder what would happen if hospitals had better logistics...</p>
<p>Some noisy kids where also there: little Leoni and her brother Dominik. Leoni brought a baby carriage with her, transporting her baby doll, and she crashed into a nurse twice. Leoni and her brother (they are about 3 and 4 years old), had such a nice character, you just want to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">smash them both against the floor</span> give them a nice hug. Those kids were the complete opposite of 'well educated'. Anti-authoritarian education is a thing of the past, and proofed not to work in real life situations. Next time I'll bring a muzzle and some duct tape ;-)</p>
