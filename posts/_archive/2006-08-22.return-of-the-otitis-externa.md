<p>On Saturday I thought that my otitis externa is gone. On Sunday it returned, with much more pain than before. And I trusted those iditos at the hospital... Well, yesterday I visited a specialist, who reinforced me in my opinion about the hospital. And today I coudln't go to work, because of immense pain in the last night, making it impossible for me to sleep. I was awake from 10p.m. until 4a.m. and then I somehow managed to sleep at least one hour. And when I woke up this morning, I was soaked in sweat. Furthermore I have to take anitbiotics, and the next ear-check is on Thursday. And I hope that I'm getting well soon, I can't stand being sick :)</p>
