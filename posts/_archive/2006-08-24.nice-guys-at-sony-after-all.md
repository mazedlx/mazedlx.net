                <p><img class="postimg" id="image691" alt="PSP" src="/uploads/psp3.png" />The UMD-slot of my PSP is defective, and I can't imagine why. I have neither dropped it nor have I treated it ruggedly. Be that as it may, getting a replacement isn't that simple as that. Due to the fact that I bought my PSP online at amazon.de, Sony recommends to send the Package back to the retailer, which is Amazon, and guess what, recommends to send it back to the manufacturer which is Sony. And Amazon makes better case fo sending it back to Sony, because warranty handling via Amazon could take up to 6 weeks plus the time Sony sends Amazon a new PSP. So I called Sony one week ago, and told the phonelady my tale of woe. She replied to me that she can't do anything for me and I should contact the retailer. Okay, been there, done that, bought a tshirt and called Sony again the other day. Same reply, but she offered me to inform her senior to call me back, maybe he can offer me another solution and guess what, he didn't call me. Called Sony again on Wednesday, her senior is on a fair in Germany, but she gave me his cell phone number. And today I called him, he was in a meeting (I couldn't care less), the senior himself picked up and, hooray for me, I don't have to send the package to Amazon, but can go to some Store in Vienna, who will do the exchange task for me. Being annoying and keep calling back sure made an impact on the guys and ladies at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe :)</p>
