                <p><img id="image694" alt="Kim Jong Il" class="postimg" src="/uploads/kimjongil.png" />There's much news at the moment about the case 'Natascha Kampusch', <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/08/25/austria.kidnap/index.html">a girl that was kidnapped 8 years ago, and now made it to escape her captor</a> (BBC and even CNN reported about it). That is what concerns Austria the most right now, followed shortly by the ongoing election campaigns for parliament election on October 1st. What concers me right now is that North Korea is threatening South Korea and US with an (atomic) pre-emptive strike, if the South and US troops keep on joining together for military practice. Now that's what nobody is talking about at the moment. That Kim Jong Il is nuts enough to drop the A-Bomb on US troops, and then we have World War III....</p>
