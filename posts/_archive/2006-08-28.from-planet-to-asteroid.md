                <p><img class="postimg" id="image697" alt="Pluto" src="/uploads/pluto.png" />Pluto is no planet anymore? Yes, on August 24th 2006 it was declassified by the International Astronomical Union (<a href="http://www.iau.org/">IAU</a>) from planet to dwarf planet, or more like to asteroid ;-)</p>
<p>I still wonder how it can be that some (mad) scientists decide to overthrow 70 years of knowledge, imagine all the books that have to be newly written and all the wikipedia entries that have to be updated ;-) And what about those mnemonic tricks to remember the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">nine</span> eight planets. When quantum physics came up, books had to be written newly too, but that was necessary, because of the lack of validity of Einstein's theory of relativity when looking at subatomic particles but nobody would be bothered by granting Pluto the rank of planet.
And what about Mickey Mouse's dog?</p>
