                <p><img id="image711" src="/uploads/esterhazy.png" alt="Esterhazy" class="postimg" />...and I did it for my love :-) On Saturday Dietmar, Nadine, Ulli, Sandra and I went to Eisenstadt for the 'Festival of the 1000 wines', taking place in the park of castle Esterh√°zy. And no, we didn't taste all of them ;-) Before we drove home, Dietmar and I proved our shooting skills at the shooting gallery. And I shot a very lovely plush tiger for Sandra. Dietmar shot a bear saying 'Get Well Soon' for Nadine :-)</p>
