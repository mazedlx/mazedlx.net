                <p><img id="image723" src="/uploads/otitis.png" alt="otitis.png" class="postimg"/>Guess what! Now that my right ear seems to be fine, it starts to hurt in my left ear. I wonder how that otitis realised that it has to move to the other side. The doc said that it sometimes just happens when using antibiotics, no one can say why. I have to admit that it isn't as painful on the left side, as it was on the right side, just some kind of annoying. Man, I certainly hope that this all disappears as soon as possible, I need both ears for clear stereo listening and the like. Going to the cinema and listening to music is only half the fun when your half-eared ;-) </p>
