title: The Pope, The Islam And A Dead Nun

                <p><img id="image725" src="/uploads/poperatzi.png" alt="Pope" class="postimg"/>That pope is one kind of a stupid idiot :-) I expect all my dear readers to have read, or at least heard about what the pope said about the Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany in his speech. If not here is the short version (saying anything about Islam, Quran or Mohammed, or anything else related is always a bad idea): Pope Benedict XVI quoted imperator Manuel II as the following:</p>
<blockquote>Manuel II said: Show me what Mohammed brought to you and all you will find is foul and inhumane.</blockquote>
<p>And that was a starter's gun for worldwide discussion about the pope. An italian nun called Leonella and her somalian bodyguard were shot dead recently in Somalia's capitol Mogadishu. Those homicides were perpetrated as an answer to the pope's statement, that is what Yusuf Mohamed Siad, security commissioner of Somalia, thinks. This seems to be Level 2 of the Mohammed cartoon conflict.
I mean no catholic ass would itch if some muslim would create a Jesus cartoon, e.g.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img id="image726" src="/uploads/cool%20jesus.png" alt="cool jesus.png" /></div>
<p>I'm an atheist, so all religions can kiss my ass, although I sympathise with Buddhism, because Buddha says:</p>
<blockquote>Do whatever you like, as long as you do not harm anyone.</blockquote>
<p>That should be any religion's credo. And one of mine is:</p>
<blockquote>I dont believe in a god that I need to worship,
I don't believe that I need to get down on my knees,
I don't believe in a voice from above can help me,
I only believe in what I can see and the things that I can achieve.
(Clawfinger, Two Sides)</blockquote>
<p>And if you don't read any new blog entries from now on, then some fundamentalists blasted my head off :-D</p>
