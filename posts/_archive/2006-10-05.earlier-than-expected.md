                <p><img id="image758a" src="/uploads/bmw.png" alt="bmw.png" class="postimg"/>The car dealer of my choice called in yesterday after Sandra and I completed our weekly foode shoppe plundering :-) At first I thought that he would tell me about problems with the production of my BMW 1er, but when he said that he has been to a workshop and in the meantime someone placed a neat blue car in his office, I was completely speechless. My car is ready for collection and that almost 2 weeks before the agreed date. I just love BMW :-) Only problem we have got right now, is Sandra's Mazda. We wanted to sell that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">piece of crap</span> fine car in 2 weeks to a guy in Graz who already said that waiting until mid-October would be no problem for him. I hope that he will be happy about that :-) I had problems getting to sleep last night, grinning like the Cheshire Cat hurts after some time ;)</p>
