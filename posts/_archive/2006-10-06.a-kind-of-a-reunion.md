                <p><img id="image769" src="/uploads/hellfish.thumbnail.png" alt="hellfish.png" class="postimg" />Ah, that was some fine beer yesterday - and thanks to Wogri, who is not in possession of a bottle opener my teeth had to serve as one. But stop! Isn't that dangerous and extremely unhealthy? Of course it is, but my dentist says that my teeth are in extremely good shape and it doesn't hurt - otherwise I wouldn't use them for such tasks ;-) Wogri, Hias, Wogri's girlfriend G. (I know her name, but the her iPhoto Album is just called g.) and last but not least Greuff, who showed up about five minutes before Elvis left the building (I had to get to my train). Due to the fact that Wogri's fridge is kind of empty</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imagelink" href="/uploads/image_058.jpg" title="image_058.jpg"><img id="image768" src="/uploads/image_058.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image_058.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>we had to call the nearest pizza delivery service. And without a menu but with the help of google we ordered one 'Diavolo', one 'Quattro Stagione' and one 'Calzone'. To my surprise alle three were available and so we starved the next 45 minutes. We didn't really starve but those chips weren't as sating as we expected them to be.
And after some slideshow powered by iPhoto from Wogri's and Hias' Bali-We-learn-to-surf-trip, the fine Italian food arrived.
When I first stepped into Wogri's appartment, I thought I had an optical illusion, but no, it is true:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imagelink" href="/uploads/image_057.jpg" title="image_057.jpg"><img id="image767" src="/uploads/image_057.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image_057.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>What you see here is a 20&quot; iMac combined with a 20&quot; widescreen LCD monitor and powerBook 'just for a fun' :-) I stated that this screen combiniation is that huge, that Wogri could use Google Earth, zoom down to 3ft and even then is able to see the whole world :D
I'm looking forward to the next meeting, as this one didn't last long though it was really fun!</p>
