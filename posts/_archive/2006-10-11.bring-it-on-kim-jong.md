                <p><img id="image694a" src="/uploads/kimjongil.png" alt="Kim Jong Il" class="postimg"/>Yes he's got A-bombs, and he tested one already, and he will test another one, and drop one over to the US, and... And why is all the fuss about him having A-bombs? The US have them, France has them, Japan has them, Russia has them - almost everyone (except Austria - our military is more like a joke) has got A-bombs. It's like a 'Who-has-the-biggest-dick'-competition. And they're all currently placing their 'Nuke-Finger' over the red button, because Kim Jong Il is testing his armory. Why do we believe that one nation is more responsible in exposure to nuclear weapons than the other? And should we fear WWIII? And how can writing angry letters telling how angry you are and applying sanctions against North Korea be of any help to mankind? Shouldn't we all think about stomping those <abbr title="weapons of mass destruction">WMD</abbr> into the ground instead of using them against each other? How can killing be of any help? And why can't someone assign a fashion advisor to Kimg Jong Il? :D</p>
