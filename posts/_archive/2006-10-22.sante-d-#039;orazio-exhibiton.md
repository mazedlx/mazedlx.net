                <p><img id="image782" src="/uploads/pam.png" alt="pam.png" class="postimg"/>Today Margit, Andi, Sandra and I to broaden our cultural horizon at the Sante D'Orazio exhibiton at <a href="http://www.kunsthauswien.com">Kunsthaus Wien</a>. D'Orazio's photographs of celebrities were fun to see, but we spent more time in the Kunsthaus caf√© :-) Afterwards we saunterd down K&auml;rnter Stra&szlig;e to Stephansplatz and then to the Maredo Steak House (for some refreshments in terms of steak). The underground parking lot (K&auml;rnterstra&szlig;en Garage) we drove in was packed with some nice cars, especially two, identical in construction, Aston Martin DB9, both LHD vehicles and both with GB license plate, some Porsche Cayenne S, Mercedes CLS and some AMG's. And the finest car of them all, the police Smart:</p>

<p>And I thought emergency vehicles should be fast ;) And I'm already working on the completely 'About Andi' post which I promised to write for Andi today at Maredo Steak House - hold on! :D</p>
