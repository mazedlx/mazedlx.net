title: Return Of My PSP

                <p><img id="image608a" src="/uploads/PSPGrande.png" alt="PSP" class="postimg"/>I picked my PSP up yesterday (the UMD slot had to be repaired) and judging from the date of the post where I mentioned that it needs to be repaired, two months have passed. This means that if I had returned the PSP to Amazon, it would have arrived at the earliest in December. I would like to thank Mr. Sch&ouml;ffmann from Sony Computer Entertaiment Austria for his advice and efforts to get my PSP repaired and Mr. Krenn from Powerplay Lugner City, who instantiated the repairing procedure. Powerplay also equipped me with a brand new Value Pack, because of Sony keeping my Giga Pack (I returned the complete box, not only the PSP itself) :D</p>
