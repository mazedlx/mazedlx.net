                <p><img id="image788" src="/uploads/nosmoking.png" alt="nosmoking.png" class="postimg"/>My colleague at work, Fritz, called my attention to an article on orf.at. The Weinstein Company, founded by legendary Bob and Harvey Weinstein (to be true, I've never heard anything about those two) commit theirself to providing their DVDs which are produced after December 2006 with warning notices when ever there is a smoking scene.</p>
<p>Imagine Rambo VII dropping atom bombs everywhere as he walks, killing an enormous number of people, giving everyone a headshot, women, children, he doesn't care at all. And as he lights up a cigarette, dangling at the corner of his mouth, a &quot;Smoking causes cancer&quot; notice pops up. I hate the US double moral standard. Having the highest porn sales worldwide (and largest porn market) and to say that sex before marriage is a sin doesn't suit me at all. Come on! We're living in the 21st century, if someone wants to smoke she/he just will, and if she/he dies of lung cancer she/he has to blame her/himself, not the Marlboro Man!</p>
