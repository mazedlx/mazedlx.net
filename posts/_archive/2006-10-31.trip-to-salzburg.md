                <p><img id="image793" src="/uploads/salzburg.thumbnail.png" alt="salzburg.png" class="postimg"/>Sandra and I recently went to Salzburg for a two-day-culture-and-seightseeing-trip. We arrived on Friday forenoon, checked in at the Astoria, and then travelled to the House of Nature by bus (what I found very impressive is that Salzburg's omnibus lines are operated electrically). After the House of Nature, which is a mixture of a museum for technics and one for natural history, we went to the Getreidegasse, which is THE shopping street in Salzburg (which proves to be true when inspecting the prices), and Sandra popped her Louis-Vuitton-cherry when we walked into the Salzburg LV store. That handbag she wants costs 580 bucks, but I think it is worth it - handcrafted things do cost - and as long as I don't have to buy them ... ;-) </p>
<p>Followed by that exquisite experience we moved on for lunch to - take a guess - the Maredo Steak House :-) With full stomach and all footsore we moved on to the stronghold Hohensalzburg, which can be reached by foot or with the Festungsbahn, a train especially built for lame tourists :-) 40 seconds later and 18 bucks needier we arrived on top of the Kapuzinerberg, where Hohensalzburg is located. We visited some exhibitions and after that drove back to our appartement.</p>
<p>On thing I love about Salzburg is, that most of the buildings in the inner city are carved out of stone, which leads to a shortage of space. I went to a tobacconist, where 2 ladies worked behind the desk, one of them was pregnant. Who ever said that where one body resides there may not be another one was not right in this case. Those two ladies kind of superposed each other. And when I walked out the two customers behind me had to get out too - first in, all out so to say :-)</p>
<p>One Saturday Sandra and I visited the zoo in Salzburg, and Sandra seized her chance, when we walked into the petting zoo</p>

<p>After that we drove to Lower Austria again, to visit a fellow student of Sandra whose parents run what we call Heuriger in Austria. The one thing special about that is that they serve ostrich meat which just tastes delicious ;-) </p>
<p>Was a nice two-day-trip, the run-in of our BMW is accomplished, and the number of region captials we still have to visit decreased from six to five :-)</p>
