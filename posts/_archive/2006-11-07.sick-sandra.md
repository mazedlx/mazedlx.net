                <p><img id="image796" src="/uploads/sicksali.png" alt="sicksali.png" class="postimg" width="150px"/>Sandra is sick at the moment, doesn't feel very well and has gone to bed damn early today (19:00). And I have promised to write her a kind of 'get well soon'-post, and here it is. Recently she had complained about not even catching a cold so she can not skive off work. When she dwelled together with her parents, she had a cold at least once a year, passed from her mum to her dad (or the other way round) and finally to herself. And due to the fact I don't get sick, she wont too ;) Well, it looks like an 'I decide what to watch on TV' -evening.</p>
<p>Yesterday we were bowling with my colleague at work Fritz and his wife Claudia. And Fritz kicked my ass ;-) But accumulated scores show that Sandra and I have won the couple contest ;-)</p>
<p>I've got some new CDs recently, which I, that's what I hope at least, have the chance to listen to the next days. You wan't to know what CDs? Here's the list:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Deftones - Saturday Night Wrist</li>
        <li>Papa Roach - The Paramour Sessions</li>
    <li>Dry Kill Logic - Of Vengeance and Violence</li>
    <li>Killswitch Engage - When Daylight Dies</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the news for now :) </p>
