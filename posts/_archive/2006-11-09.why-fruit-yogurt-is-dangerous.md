                <p><img id="image798" src="/uploads/yogurt.png" alt="yogurt.png" class="postimg"/>I learned a very disturbing fact at yesterdays billard session: bullets do not have enough energy to knock someone down, not even a Desert Eagle Point Five O. And here is why:
The Energy of a moving body can be described as</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/1/231cfd9416f4736f5ee8d102ee84cb22.png" alt="Ekin" /></div>
<p>where m is the mass and v is the speed of the body.
A normal bullet weighs about 15 grammes [g], or 0,015 kilogrammes [kg] and normal exit speed is about 900 feet per second, which is equal to 300 metres per second [m/s]. This sums up in a total Energy of 675 kg m² / s² or 675 Joules [J].
A normal fruit yogurt weighs about 250 g, and its nutrion table tells us a total energy of 1046 J, when standing in the fridge. Just imagine the enormous amount of kinetic energy when you buy a yogurt and take it home with your Lamborghini at 330 km/h, that would result in a kinetic energy of 2100 J! And only 4,185 J are needed to heat up water by 1°C ... I still wonder why nobody shoots with yogurt ...</p>
