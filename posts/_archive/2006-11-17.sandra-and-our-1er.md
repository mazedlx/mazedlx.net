<p>When ever Sandra drives alone with our 1er, which happens to be quite often, she has always a story to tell. Here's a short list of those treasure-like statements:</p>
<blockquote>Today I smoked a brand-new Audi A3. The guy who drove it was my age - and he didn't have a chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It was kind of slippery on the streets and the ESP warning light flashed the whole time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Everyone gets big eyes when they see me in this ride.</blockquote>
