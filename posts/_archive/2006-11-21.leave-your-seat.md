                <p>Anyone knows those signs placed in subways over certain seats, to leave for older people, the blind, pregnant women, women with small children and so on. An in Tokyo's subways, those signs look like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imagelink" href="/uploads/tokyosubway.png" title="tokyosubway.png"><img id="image813" src="/uploads/tokyosubway.thumbnail.png" alt="tokyosubway.png" /></a></div>
<p>You should leave your seat for</p>
<ol>
    <li>People with a broken arm</li>
    <li>Women with small children</li>
    <li>Pregnant women</li>
    <li>People with a broken leg</li>
</ol>
<p>Pictograms rule the universe!</p>
