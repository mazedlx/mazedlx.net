                <p><img id="image824" src="/uploads/counter-strike-2.png" alt="counter-strike-2.png" class="postimg"/>A few days ago, a German high school was held hostage by a an armed guy, who was also be a former student. He got humilitated all the time by his class mates in earlier days and then one day he decided to take revenge. Different from the Columbine massacre, nobody was killed, but some got hurt. And before SWAT could grapple him, he killed himself.
And now German politicans blame it all on what they call 'killer games'. And they want to ban those games, because of their believe that such games are the #1 reason for kids to go berzerk, grab a gun and blast brains out.
I came across an article on <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/skowhegan/-skowhegan-detective-217875.php">kotaku.com</a>, saying that some kids tinkered together acid bombs. And the chief of the local police knows what made those kids to do so: GTA (Grand Theft Auto) and the main reason for that geek in Germany to come back to school and to create another Columbine obviously was his passion for Counter-Strike, Quake and Doom. At least that is what politicans say.
What I don't understand is, that I've played those games too, and, funnily enough, didn't kill anybody. I also played Need for Speed and didn't drive through playgrounds at Mach 1 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">yet</span> ;). Another superb scape goat is to blame it on superb bands like Slipknot and their music - and I have never sacrificed a goat or slit my throat and kept walking :D
We must not blame it on those games - killing people on your PC or console does not make you a mass murder. But when kids at the age of 10 are cracks when it comes to Medal of Honour and the like, then something is going wrong.
By the way, I played GTA 3, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas, and just can not remember one mission where I had to use acid bombs ;)</p>
