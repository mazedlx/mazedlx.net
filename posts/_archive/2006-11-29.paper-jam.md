                <p><img id="image821" src="/uploads/zahnraeder.png" alt="zahnraeder.png" class="postimg" height="100px"/>We just had a paper jam in our office printer which happens to be an enormous HP9000 i-can-do-everything-grey-plastic-monster. Fritz followed the instructions on the screen to remove the jammed paper, but didn't succeed. I offered him my help and Milan, who is another colleague at work said</p>
<blockquote>The machine never backs down regardless of how high social pressure may be.</blockquote>
<p>We finally removed that one page which was hiding somewhere in the depths of the printer. And Fritz finally received his hardcopy.</p>
