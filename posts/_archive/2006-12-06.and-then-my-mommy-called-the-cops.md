                <p><img id="image830" src="/uploads/present.png" alt="present.png" class="postimg"/>I'v just read an article in an Austrian newspaper that in the land of the free (where else) a 12 year old boy was arrested when his mom called the police to seize him because he took a sneak peak on his Christmas present, a Nintendo Gameboy. The boy had to rot in the police post for some time, and after sunday church service, his mom came by to pick him up. The boy suffers from ADD (attention deficit disorder) - or as my mom calls it: that's not a disease, that's a lame excuse. I also sneaked around  to get a peak on my presents for Christmas, but my mom didn't ever call the police. Nor did she know that I sneaked around to find my presents. Mom, I only did that once <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a year</span>, so please don't call the cops or tell grandma ;-)</p>
