                <p><img id="image834" src="/uploads/topgear-pres.thumbnail.jpg" alt="topgear-pres.jpg" class="postimg"/>I recently wrote an email to <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/topgear">BBC's Top Gear Crew</a> asking if there is the possibility that my mate Andi and I could get a driving lesson with 'The Stig', or, at least, signed t-shirts. But I didn't receive any reply yet - except for that automatic 'we received your email'-stuff. I certainly hope that this blog entry pulls out all the stops and gets Andi and me in the door at Top Gear HQ :-)</p>
<p>By the way: Sandra is currently at the Christmas party of the company she's working at and I do hope that she isn't pissed as a fart when she gets home ;-) Sandra is kind of easy going when it comes to mullet wine. Last time she had 5 of them and certainly had to be walked home ;-)</p>
