<p>Apple now sells mobile phones, not right now at the moment but in the near future: <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">the iPhone</a>. This device features everything, from touchscreen, to iPod, to camera, to wireless lan, to ... whatever man, it just features everything a handheld device should offer. One mobile phone to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rule</span> call them all.
I've heard that prices should be USD 399 for the 4GB model. I wonder if this phone takes over the world like the iPod did. And there still isn't any competiton -  that Microsoft zune ought to be, but I think it was a miscarriage produced by marketers in Redmond. Why would anyone want to buy a piece of crap that is the same price as an iPod nano, weighs more, is larger and has features you never wanted an mp3 player to have? Wonder how Nokia and SonyEricsson will respond to the iPhone...</p>
