                <p><img src='/uploads/simp31.jpg' alt='simp31.jpg' class="postimg"/>Thanks go out to Margit who told me that the <a href="http://www.smashingpumpkins.com">Smashing Pumpkins</a> seem to have reunited, based on the fact that they appear on this years <a href="http://www.novarock.at">NovaRock</a> lineup. Funny though, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins#The_reunion">Billy Corgan already announced a reunion back in 2005</a>.
In fact they are currently in the studio recording a new album. The Smashing Pumpkins were on of my favourite bands in the late 90s and I'm looking forward to their new songs. I could not find any information on release dates nor on the title of their upcoming work. </p>
