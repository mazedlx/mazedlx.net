title: Insufficient Memory

                <p>Due to a memory_size_limit of 8M in my providers php.ini some parts of mazedlx.net just break down, when allocationg too much memory for some scripts. (well 8M is not that much, but if thousand or more users have one virtual webserver, all running on just one single machine, it just runs out of RAM, that's what the restriction is to avoid). And I can't change the limit via set_ini(), because safe_mode is on. Well, I wrote them an email and kindly asked to raise my limit to 10M or better 12M, so the scripts won't die. Sections that are concerned are e.g. the sports section and when ever I publish a new post and the <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/07/21/google-sitemap-generator-for-wordpress-27">google sitemap plugin</a> wants to create an actual XML sitemap (deactivated that one temporarily)
I first installed the <a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">wp-cache plugin</a>, but it won't help, the server won't deliver that page to get it cached, because the script dies before anything does happen.</p>
