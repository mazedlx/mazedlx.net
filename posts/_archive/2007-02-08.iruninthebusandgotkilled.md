                <p><img src='/uploads/kruger03.thumbnail.jpg' alt='kruger03.jpg' class='postimg'/>Just read an article about some bloke called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Kruger">Carl Kruger</a> who wants to ban the use of iPods while crossing streets. Not only iPods, but PSPs, PDAs, anything that distracts pedestrians from looking for traffic before walking in front of a speeding bus. Three people have been killed in his neighbourhood, while changing playing tracks, checking their mails or setting new high scores. </p>
