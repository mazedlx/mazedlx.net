                <p>Mom, Sandra and I went to Vienna, to visit the newly opened <a href="http://www.tmw.at">Museum of Technics</a>. I felt like being a little boy again, pushing all those buttons and pulling all those levers, and even running in the hamster's treadmill producing energy.</p>

<p>I also sat on an erometer an had a power output of 120 watts! For two seconds or so ;)</p>
