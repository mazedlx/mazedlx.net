                <p>I changed the WordPress plugin that caches my site from wp-cache to <a href="http://photomatt.net/2004/07/26/staticize-25/">staticize</a>, and it works fine, nevertheless, the sports section still dies when using WordPress functions - that damn memory_size_limit ;-) I wrote an email off to <a href="http://www.kt-net.at/">kt-net</a>, asking for a price quotation for hosting my site.</p>
