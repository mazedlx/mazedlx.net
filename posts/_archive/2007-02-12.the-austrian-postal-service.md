                <p>The Austrian postal service is a bunch of idiots. I recently ordererd an Apple keyboard and mighty mouse, to <a href="http://mazedlx.net/index.php/2007/01/24/imaze-switch-completed/">replace my wireless keyboard and wireless mighty mouse</a>. And the package was sent to my office on February 6th. And due to the fact that my office is located in the building of the technical evening school and last week happened to be semester break, the postman couldn't enter the building after 3 p.m. So he must have said to hisself 'wel there ain't nobody at home' and sent the package back to where it came from, containing a note: 'receipient unknown'. I swear to god if I see some postal guy today I'm gonna <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kill him</span> badly hurt him. What a bunch of stupid idiots.</p>
