title: Spring Fever On mazedlx.net?
tags:

                <p>Seems like nothing ever happens in my life that is worth enough to be written down and told to the world. At least the last few days where not quite exciting as usual. Made some nightly pictures of my BMW 1er, had to test the tripod Sandra gave me as birthday present.</p>

<a href='/uploads/bmw_nightly_1.jpg' title='bmw_nightly_1.jpg'><img src='/uploads/bmw_nightly_1.thumbnail.jpg' alt='bmw_nightly_1.jpg' /></a> <a href='/uploads/bmw_nightly_2.jpg' title='bmw_nightly_2.jpg'><img src='/uploads/bmw_nightly_2.thumbnail.jpg' alt='bmw_nightly_2.jpg' /></a> <a href='/uploads/bmw_nightly_3.jpg' title='bmw_nightly_3.jpg'><img src='/uploads/bmw_nightly_3.thumbnail.jpg' alt='bmw_nightly_3.jpg' /></a>
</div>
<p>I also changed the theme on my mac, because nobody at the macuser.de forums would make me a proper itunes skin for <a href="http://interfacelift.com/themes-mac/details.php?id=85">this theme</a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href='/uploads/desktop.jpg' title='desktop.jpg'><img src='/uploads/desktop.thumbnail.jpg' alt='desktop.jpg' /></a></div>
<p>To be honest the macuser.de forums only consist of flaming assholes, telling me to buy windows xp, or move to the teletubby house. Not everyone associates blue and green with windows. They do and they suck :-) I now use <a href="http://gui.interacto.net/">UNO 1.5</a> to get a persistent design for all my mac apps. I know that the standard Aqua theme is one of the best, but a little bit of individualism doesn't hurt :-)</p>
<p>And to kill some time I've designed a new logo for my website</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href='/uploads/header.png' title='header.png'><img src='/uploads/header.thumbnail.png' alt='header.png' /></a></div>
<p>I thought a bit webtwodotnil would not be amiss.</p>
<p>I don't think that until Saturday, April 10th anything remarkable will happen. Ah, yes, my parents will return on Friday from their trip around the world. This means I'll have to pick them up from the airport, will hopefully receive my origami paper and some other presents from Nippon and Down Under, and that I'll spend the next weekends cutting their movie evidence of their trip :-)</p>
