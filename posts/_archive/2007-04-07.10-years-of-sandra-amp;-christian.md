                <p><img src='/uploads/red-rose-p1-love.thumbnail.jpg' alt='red-rose-p1-love.jpg' class="postimg"/>Yes, it's our tenth anniversary. A decade ago I've asked Sandra if she'd be my girlfriend and, obviously, she said yes.
In those ten years we had our ups and downs, but mostly ups, making it worthwhile to spend time together. Sandra, I love you, and always will. You're the best thing that could possibly ever happen to me! And tonight I'll take you out to a fancy restaurant, I'll pay the bill, you'll taste the wine. And I'm very certain that the next ten years will be even better :-)</p>
