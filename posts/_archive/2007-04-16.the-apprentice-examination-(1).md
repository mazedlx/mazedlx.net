                <p>Today and tomorrow I'm going to be a part of the apprentice examination committee for IT and technical apprenticeships . This is my first time to be part of that committee, so I'll be just sitting there watching the usual business. The exam consists of two parts, a theoretical and an oral exam. In the theoretical exam, the apprentices have to assemble a PC and install various kinds of software, for the oral exam they have to answer questions related to their technical apprenticeship, e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is light a wave or a stream of particles</span> why do we want to partition a hard drive :-)</p>
