<p>Everyone will have heard about the massacre at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, where 23 year old Cho Seung Hui, English student killed 32 people, including his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend, before committing suicide. Sincere condolences to all the friends and relatives of the victims. I was surprised that Cho didn't play Counterstrike in his spare time, but wrote bizarre and morbid plays and novels. But in a state like Virginia, where you are allowed to wear a weapon in public and that holds the headquarter of the NRA, anyone can be the next mass murderer.</p>
