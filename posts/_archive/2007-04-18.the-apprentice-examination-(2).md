                <p>Was kind of fun today, but I'm kind of scared to, some people just don't know the easiest things, e.g. what rights and duties does an employee and the employer have. Well, on May 14th and May 15th I'm going to examine apprentices too, but this time not as assessor but as examiner. And getting paid too :-)</p>
