                <p>Today and tomorrow I'll be at the <a href="http://www.bfi.at/de/">BFI</a>, the largest institute in Austria for further education and training to test a 'new' generation of IT technicians. Except for one apprentice all of them are older than me, meaning that they've already worked before in another industry. The movtivation of those guys is the complete opposite to the one I've seen last time. And so is their IQ ;-)</p>
