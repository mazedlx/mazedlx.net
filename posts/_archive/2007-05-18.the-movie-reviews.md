title: The Movie Reviews

                <p>To mark this special occasion I'm proud to announce that from now on I'll need more than two ratings for my movie reviews. Until yesterday it seemed to be sufficent to rate movies with 'Must See' which would be a grade A, and 'Good One' which would be grade B. But after yesterday's visit to the cinema for Spider-Man 3 I'm back to bitter reality. Normally I would try to avoid watching movies from which I'm not convinced that they're worth the money, so I'd pick out the movies I want to watch, and afterwards give them an A or a B rating. But Spider-Man 3, no matter how hard I tried to bend the rules, is neither a 'Must See' nor a 'Good One'. And to avoid more lack of clarity in my movie reviews, here is the official mazedlx.net movie ranking:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Must See</strong> - these movies were that good I'd buy the DVD the moment it is released.</li>
    <li><strong>Good One</strong> - these movies were nice to watch, I'd buy the DVD when it is at discount.</li>
    <li><strong>I'd expected more</strong> - these movies were neither fish nor fowl, I won't buy the DVD.</li>
    <li><strong>No Fun At All</strong> - these movies were that bad, they didn't even had one good scene.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay At Home And Save The Money</strong> - these movies were really bad. Putting the spent money on fire at least would keep you warm for a while. I wouldn't even download that kind.</li>
</ul>
