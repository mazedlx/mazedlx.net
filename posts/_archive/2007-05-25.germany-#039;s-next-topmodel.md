                <p><a href="http://www.prosieben.de/lifestyle_magazine/topmodel/index.php">Germany's next topmodel</a> is a show hosted by Heidi Klum and a bunch of gay guys. I'm not homophobic, but those guys are really gay, like in </p>

<p>Anyway, the purpose - at least that is what I'm thinking - is to cast girls that think they have the face and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body-mass-index">BMI</a> the next topmodel needs. Well, to be honest, that show is a failure. You maybe think 'Maze is an idiot. Those girls rock! I would fuck them immediately'. No they don't. And, no you wouldn't. You see, those girls represent today's established ideal of beauty. Which is - in my humble opinion - not representing today's established ideal of the woman a man wants. For example, whenever you walk down the street, let's say in summer, and a girl passes you by, which is 1.80m high and weighs 60 kilos, you wouldn't recognize her at all or just think 'Man, she's got an eating disorder'. And the problem is that men think that way, but women think 'She's perfect, slim, tall, can wear anything, hasn't got any cellulitis' and so on. Sandra asked me, which of the 3 finalists I'd take, and I replied to her with 'none' which is the plain truth. Here's an example of what women accept as the ideal woman:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href='/uploads/slimmodel.jpg' title='slimmodel.jpg'><img src='/uploads/slimmodel.thumbnail.jpg' alt='slimmodel.jpg' /></a></div>
<p>What's beautiful about her? Nothing I'd say. But this is accepted to be ideal. Not for me. What is more like it would be</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href='/uploads/babe.jpg' title='babe.jpg'><img src='/uploads/babe.thumbnail.jpg' alt='babe.jpg' /></a></div>
<p>What's beautiful about her? She's not slim, eventually got spots and cellulitis. BUT she looks nice, you're not afraid of breaking her in half, and she looks like the girl next-door. And that is what men want. Period. </p>
