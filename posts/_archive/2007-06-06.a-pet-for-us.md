                <p>I love cats. Sandra loves cats. Wouldn't it be nice to have cat? Or two? Yes it would! But we're not absoluteley sure which cat to buy, favourites are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Birman">Sacred Birman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_coon">Maine Coon</a>. Yet another problem is the horrendous price, about 700 bucks per 'piece' :-) And scratching post. And litter pan. And food. And toys. I'd say we plan our decision very wisely and wait until Christmas. But as far as I know Sandra, we'll be proud owners of two cats by the end of August ;)</p>
