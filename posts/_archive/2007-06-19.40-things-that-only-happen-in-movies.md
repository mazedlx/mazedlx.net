<li>
<p>It is always possible to find a parking spot directly outside or opposite the building you are visiting.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When paying for a taxi, don't look at your wallet as you take out a note. Just grab one out at random and hand it over. It will always be the exact fare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Television news bulletins usually contain a story that affects you personally at the precise moment it's aired.</p>

<li>
<p>If you decide to start dancing in the street, everyone you bump into will know all the steps.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Should you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer, it will not be necessary to learn to speak German. Simply speaking English with a German accent will do. Similarly, when they are alone, all German soldiers prefer to speak English to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once applied, lipstick will never rub off. Even while scuba diving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Eiffel Tower can be seen from any window of any building in Paris.</p>

<li>
<p>Getaway cars never start first go. But all cop cars do. (They will also slide to a dramatic stop in the midst of a crime scene).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If staying in a haunted house, women should investigate any strange noises wearing their most revealing underwear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a police stake-out, the action will only ever take place when food is being consumed and scalding hot coffees are perched precariously on the dashboard . . .</p>

<li>
<p>All grocery shopping involves the purchase of French loaves which will be placed in open brown paper bags (Caveat: when said bags break, only fruit will spill out).</p>

<p>If you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involving martial arts, your opponents will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around you in a threatening manner until you have defeated their predecessor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a microphone is turned on it will immediately feedback.</p>
</li>

<p>The ventilation system of any building is the perfect hiding place. Nobody will ever think of looking for you in there and you can travel to any other part of the building undetected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will survive any battle in any war UNLESS you show someone a picture of your sweetheart back home.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>One man shooting at 20 men has a better chance of killing them all than 20 men firing at once (it's called Stallone's Law).</p>
