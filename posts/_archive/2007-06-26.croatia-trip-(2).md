                <p>Monday:</p>
<p>A butterfly had the idea to land on my shoulder and to stay there for a while. Sandra took a photo of this obscure scene :-) By the way, all photos will be published when we are home again. My sunburn has increased a little bit, I do now look like a lobster with a sunburn :-)</p>
