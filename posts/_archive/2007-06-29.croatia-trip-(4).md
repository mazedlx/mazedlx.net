                <p>Thursday &amp; Friday:</p>
<p>A gecko made friendship with Sandra when it used her as springboard :-) The weather is still unfriendly and a bit to cold to lie in the sun. So we decided to drive hom this morning. All told the 6 days we spent in Croatia where fine, it could have been a bit warmer.</p>
