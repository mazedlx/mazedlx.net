title: mazedlx.net Soon Offline

                <p>My provider is changing servers, therefore I am running a cron job mysql database backup and made a full backup of my files. And that's the reason I didn't post anything new since last Saturday. That server upgrade should have been finished yesterday and I'm still waiting for mazedlx.net to be offline. So, if you can't reach my site the following days, don't be sad! mazedlx.net is going to be faster than ever in a few days ;)</p>
