                <p>I think the new iPods rock. I'd buy the iPod touch immediately, if it wasn't for its low storage capacity of 16GBs. The new nanos look like a shrunken iPod Video and feature full video playback functionality. The iPod classic now offers 160GB for the same price as the iPod Video with 80GBs. The iPhone 4GB model got stomped, only the 8GB model still available with a price drop by 200 bucks - that also caused the Apple shares to drop slightly. Now it should be affordable, but I still don't want that crap contract thing with it. That's the reason why unlocked iPhones go over the ebay-counter for at least 1000 bucks. How did those sellers get their iPhones without the AT&amp;T contract. I'd really like to know. Well, thanks to Apple's new price for the 80GB iPod classic I can't sell my 80GB iPod Video for more than 200 bucks, which leaves me with a gap of another 200 bucks to buy the iPod touch although I don't want to have that one - 16GBs, man, I really don't want to think about what I'd like to hear/see/watch the next day, but I'm certain the gadget loving part of my brain will not stop distributing endorphins every time I see the new iPod touch until I buy one.</p>
