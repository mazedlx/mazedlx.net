title: What The Hell Is ADD?

                <p>Today I saw a woman carrying some leafs. And that somehow reminded me of my childhood. I remembered the drawing lessons back in elementary school where, in autumn, we had to bring leafs for some very special drawing technique including leafs, an old toothbrush, a metal filter and a paintbox. And guess who never brought those leafs with him to class. I just enjoyed the wonderful colours of the leaves everywhere on my way to school without picking the leafs up. And today I still have problems to remember certain things, especially when Sandra tells me something to do - or not to do, certain appointments, the lot. And that leaves me with the conclusion that I must have ADD, or even AAAD (adult attention defecit disorder) :-)</p>
