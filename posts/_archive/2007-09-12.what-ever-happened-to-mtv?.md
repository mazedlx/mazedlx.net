                <p><img src='/uploads/mtvsucks.thumbnail.jpg' alt='mtvsucks.jpg' class="postimg"/>Remember those days back in the early nineties? When we came home from school, turned the TV on and switched to MTV, at that time known as Music Television. I love music, and so did MTV, a classical win-win situation, MTV gets paid for playing the videos, and the artists would sell more copies of their albums. But MTV has changed. When I now come home from work, turn on the TV and switch to MTV I don not see or hear any musicvideos. Not even one. Did MTV change their name into Moron Television overnight? Or is MTV the short version of MBASMTV (mostly bullshit and sometimes music television)? Just take a look on todays program on MTV Germany (MTV US is even worse):</p>

<p>Music from 6:00 - 10:45, from 11:00 - 12:00, from 16:30 till 18:00, then again from 20:05 -21:00 and 23:05 - 0:00 - makes a total of 9 hours and 5 minutes of music played on MTV. These times also include commercials. Isn't that awesome? </p>
<p>I want my MTV back. And so do others on this planet. I don't want to get up early in the morning or to stay up late just to have a chance catching a video not a show. We want music videos all the time. We know that there are alternatives like VH-1 or MTV2 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">or VIVA in Germany</span> (VIVA sucks too, always tried to be 'se german MTV') or GOTV in Austria (no news, no shows, just music), but we don't want to date your mom or getting involved when Flava Flav gets it on with that Nielsen freak bitch.</p>
