                <p>And their Adsense program. Just received an email that my account has been deactived due click fraud. Come on Google, I've been running Adsense for almost a year now and have earned a total of 100something dollars, and today, a few days until my first payment you bloody assholes are deactivating my account. Thanks Google, nice work. And I'm not the only one whos account has been deactivated due fraud reasons. I'm really pissed off at the moment. And I shall never use the damn Google search again, from now on I'll use Yahoo.</p>
