                <p>Yesterday we became eye witnesses of a hit-and-run accident in Wiener Neustadt. Some guy drove his delivery van against a public dust bin, and then damaged a store showcase while a turn-over. We were lucky not to get killed by that bloody idiot. Obviously Mr. delivery van driver was drunk as a newt. Him being unable to react properly, I had enough time to take a picture of his licence plate number with my mobile phone. And being a model citizen, I called the cops. :-) The delivery van was a rental car from <a href="http://www.europcar.co.at">Europcar</a> and had <strong>Rent-a-Safety-Car</strong> written on its side :D</p>
