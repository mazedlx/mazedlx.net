                <p>I jailbreaked my iPod touch yesterday, so I can use the iPhone apps and additional programs. Apple announced to release the iPhone/iPod touch SDK with February, but I don't want to wait that long. Here are the simple instructions to jailbreak your iPod touch:</p>
<ol>
        <li><a href="http://ijailbreak.com/">Download iJailBreak</a> and move the entire folder to the Applications folder</li>
    <li>Surf to http://jailbreak.toc2rta.com. Once Safari crashes, connect the iPod touch to your Mac, start iJailBreak and follow the instructions provided by iJailBreak. Don't bother if the initial jailbreaking takes up to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>You're done :-)</li>
</ol>
