title: iPod Touch WLAN Issues
tags:

                <p>My iPod touch did connect to wiress LAN networks flawlessly, at least at home it did. At work it just wouldn't. Until 5 minutes ago. I spoke to our LAN administrator and together we figured out that the iPod touch has problems connecting to wireless networks that are broadcasted from access points which are able to broadcast multiple wireless networks. In my case a HP ProCurve Wireless LAN Access Point, that broadcasts two different SSIDs, one for every configured VLAN. The network I've been trying to connect was broadcasted as secondary network  we changed that to primary and that solved the problem. That is some strange behaviour. First I thought that the iPod touch cannot handle AES encryption with WPA-PSK networks, no, the iPod touch is that intelligent, it knows which encryption standard to use, I proved that by taking my old WLAN router (Belkin) and trying every possible wireless constellation (WPA with AES/TKIP encryption and with/without SSID broadcast), and the iPod always connected to the particular network trouble-free.</p>
