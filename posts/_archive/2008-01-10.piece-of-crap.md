                <p>I got my first mobile phone back in 1997, a Motorola D520, a durable mobile phone capable of  calling, receiving calls, writing text messages and receiving them, and keeping your contacts together. Today, I'm using the most annoying mobile device in world's history: the HTC S310, which calls itself a smartphone. Compared to the Motorola, it features a whole buttload of cool things, 36 hours of stand-by time for example, or the need for a reboot every once in a while. I was glad to hear that HTC's stock is going down south. Poor products combined with an even poorer operating system sold for an unreasonable price - in other words: the perfect combination. You may ask yourself why I don't walk into the next store and buy a Nokia N-series or a new SonyEricsson, here is the answer: all those mobile phones do not run Windows Mobile. I hate Windows Mobile, but it syncs with Exchange over GPRS/UMTS, and that is the only reason why I have to use it. Period. So unless someone comes up with the same feature for Nokia or SonyEricsson I have no other choice than to use it, complain about it, and to reboot it, every once in a while.</p>
