                <p>Just some notes regarding todays keynote held by Steve Jobs. The Macbook Air seems quite astounding, I wouldn't believe that it is possible to build a notebook that is even thinner than Kate Moss. Nice gadget for sure. iPod touch/iPhone firmware update is a good idea, especially rearranging icons looks really cute, but charging customers 19 bucks sucks. Period. Apple TV 2, being a software update is a very good idea, especially because I bought an Apple TV the other day on eBay. Movie rental won't be available in Europe until further notice, but seems to be okay. Did I forget something? Ah, yes, Time Capsule an external harddisk with WiFi. If you already own an Airport Extreme base station (like me), and an external harddisk connected to the Airport Extreme and want to backup your Mac to that very harddisk, open Terminal on your Mac, enter</p>
