                <p>The link to my blog has changed, from <a href="http://mazedlx.net/wordpress">http://mazedlx.net/wordpress</a> to <a href="http://mazedlx.net/"><a href="http://mazedlx.net">http://mazedlx.net</a></a>. In 2005 I installed wordpress just for testing purposes, but now I don't think I'll ever need anything else again. If you see broken images or links to internal pages, then feel free to write a comment, but make sure you don't look at a cached version of this site!</p>
