                <p>iPhone SDK was released yesterday, and will feature fully ActiveSync capabilities coming with firmware version 2.0. Wait a second, does that mean the iPhone can now be synced with Exchange over the air, and can now send and receive contacts, appointments and mails via push technology? Yes, it does. Well done, but I'll receive my new Windows Mobile phone today, so no iPhone for me (for now). </p>
