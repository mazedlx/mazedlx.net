title: The iPhone Is Coming To Austria

                <p>And time will tell if it really is the best mobile phone ever for sale in Austria since sliced bread. Austrian mobile phone customers are very sensitive when it comes to contracts, pricing and service. The iPhone in Austria will be retailed by <a href="http://www.t-mobile.at/iphone/">T-Mobile Austria</a> and comes with two contracts, both featuring a mandatory contract period of 24 months. Both contracts include 1000 minutes calling to every Austrian mobile network, a 3GB data package, and (hopefully free) access to every Austrian T-Mobile WiFi hotspot, and cost &euro; 39 and &euro; 55. The iPhone itself costs &euro; 399  for the 8GB, and &euro; 499 for the 16GB model. The contract seems fair, but the iPhone itself is a bit pricy - seeing that unlocked 16GB models are sold for 400 bucks at ebay. Well, I'll definitely wait until June, when Apple release software version 2, and probably a 3G model.</p>
