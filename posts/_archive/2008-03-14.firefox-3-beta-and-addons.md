title: Firefox 3 Beta And AddOns
tags:

                <p>I love Firefox. And do very much appreciate that the guys at Mozilla are working on version number three of the best browser out there. But what I like most about firefox are addons. Can't live without them. <a href="http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/">Mouse Gestures</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Browser Sync</a>, the lot. And thanks to the new AddOn management in Firefox 3, they need to be updated by their respective developers. Or, you can just download <a href="http://www.oxymoronical.com/web/firefox/nightly">Nightly Tester Tools</a>, install it under Firefox 2, make your addons compatible, and disable compatibility checking, and voil&aacute; (almost) all extensions work with Firefox 3.</p>
