title: Where In The World Is My MacBook?

                <p>No one can tell. <a href="http://www.apecode.com/appletrack/">Apecode</a> shows no results at all, <a href="http://www.tnt.com/webtracker/tracker.do?navigation=1&respLang=en&respCountry=US&genericSiteIdent=">TNT logistics</a> have nothing to say either. What does help a bit, is to log into your Apple account via Apple Store US, and gather the &quot;assigned carrier&quot; information there. Mine says, that my MacBook is carried by Flextronics logistics, the rest of that same order will be merged in the Netherlands and then carried out by TNT. And the only status information available at the moment is &quot;palette closed&quot; and &quot;manifested&quot;. </p>
