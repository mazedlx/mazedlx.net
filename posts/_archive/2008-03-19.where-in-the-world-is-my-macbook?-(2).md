title: Where In The World Is My MacBook? (2)

                <p>It seems that the Apple wireless keyboard I ordered with my MacBook is waiting in Venray, Netherlands for the MacBook to arrive and to get merged into one delivery. Good things come to those who wait - or something like that. My 22&quot; HP display arrived yesterday and is also feeling kinda lonely :-)</p>
