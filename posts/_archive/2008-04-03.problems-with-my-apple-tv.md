title: Problems With My Apple TV
tags:

                <p>I tried to update my Apple TV to software version 2.0.1 the other day, but installing the update failed every time. So I decided to go for a factory restore, which turns out to be the greater of two evils. Now I'm stuck with software version 1.0, and I'm still not able to update. <a href="http://forum.awkwardtv.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1479">I created a patchstick</a> which I will test later, to install some extra tools like ssh.</p>
<p>Some forum users reported that it has to be a Leopard only issue, resulting when you upgrade your harddrive and use Leopard to clone the original drive to a new one, but I can't affirm that, I used Leopard and I updated to software version 2.0 hassle-free.</p>
