                <p>Won't you come? If you'd ask Walter Wagner, the answer is &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Some background information: At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cern">CERN</a> in Geneva, Switzerland, scientists are building a device called, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">LHC, the Lagre Hadron Collider</a>. And with the LHC it could be possilbe, if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_penrose">Roger Penrose</a> is right, to produce artificial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes</a>, which are a lot smaller than the customary black hole. Now some scientists fear that an artificial black hole could destroy our planet, the solar system, pretty much everything surrounding us at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhcdefense.org/">Walter Wagner and Luis Sancho</a> filed a lawsuit against CERN, aimed at reassessing LHC's safety measures. Tiny black holes are not their only fears, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangelet">stranglets</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole">magnetic monopoles</a> could also turn Earth into a piece of wobbling exotic matter.</p>
<p>According to my information and knowledge, black holes created in the laboratory do not exist long enough to suck up matter thus gaining mass and energy to expand into a king size hoover. Be that as it may, <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/Safety-en.html">CERN released some information</a> regarding the whole discussion.</p>
<p>When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Heavy_Ion_Collider">Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider</a> got indtroduced at the BNL in New York, Wagner predicted yet another doomsday, he feared that scientists could create an artificial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nova">super nova</a>, which would also kill everything in our solar system.</p>
<p>I believe that the LHC will bring us deeper insight in how the universe works. And if a black hole is created that sucks everything in, than at least we will not have enough time to be scared, we would get killed in the fraction of a second.</p>
