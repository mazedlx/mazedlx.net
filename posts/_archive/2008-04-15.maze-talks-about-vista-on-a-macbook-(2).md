                <p>I managed to install CounterStrike: Source the other day, and to be honest, it could be a bit smoother, but it's still playable. Also installed Office 2007, and I have to admit that Microsoft did a good job in redesigning the user interface, but it is still a bit overloaded. Only a bit. Boot time is okay, but could be faster. Shutdown time still sucks. And after a PRAM reset Vista recognized all 4GB, not just 3 of 4GB of RAM. As I said in the first post about Vista, I installed it only and only for gaming purpose, nothing else. Well, okay, to get used to it so that I don't have to when my company migrates from Windows XP and Office 2003 - won't need any training at all.</p>
<p>So here is my conclusion:</p>
<p>Vista is Windows like we wanted it to be 5 years ago. The user interface got redesigned in an eye cancer avoiding way and it feels right. But you need a whole lot of new hardware to get things up and running.</p>
