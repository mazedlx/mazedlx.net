                <p>And paired your device with that very remote? Then you need to</p>
<p>a) look more closely to find that remote, or</p>
<p>b) take another Apple remote, aim it at your MacBook, Apple TV or whatever and press Menu + Rewind, until you see the icon with the broken chain, this will unpair the lost remote.</p>
<p>To pair that other remote press Menu + Forward, until you see the icon with the intact chain. This information saved me a lot of time and trouble with Sandra, who wasn't able to watch &quot;The Closer&quot; with the Apple TV</p>
