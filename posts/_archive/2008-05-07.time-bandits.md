                <p>Remember <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/">Time</a> <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_bandits/">Bandits</a>? A movie intended to be watched by kids, back in the early 80s. I watched that movie when I was kid, and nontypical for a movie for kids it doesn't have a happy ending, spolier ahead, the main role kid parents get killed at the end.</p>
