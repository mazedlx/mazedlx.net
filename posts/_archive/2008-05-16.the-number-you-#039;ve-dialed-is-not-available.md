                <p>I'll be going to France tomorrow, so you, my dear friend, will not be able to reach me via telephone, my company won't pay for roaming. So how do you get in contact with me between May 17th and May 24th:</p>
<ul>
    <li>send me an email (there should be public access WiFi in the hotel we're staying at),</li>
    <li>call Sandra on her mobile phone, and ask for me :-)</li>
    <li>wait until Saturday, May 24th, when I'll turn my mobile on again</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that you all will miss me, but as I mentioned above, the French are online - although they have no words for eighty and ninety or concatenated nouns, but still they do manage to surf the web and to build cars - and I'll post news and pictures of our stay here.</p>
<p>Bonne chance et au revoir!</p>
