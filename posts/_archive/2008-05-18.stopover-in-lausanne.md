                <p>After 10 hours of driving through Austria (we decided to take the tour over the Arlberg not under it), Germany and almost all of Switzerland we arrived in Lausanne yesterday. There is public WiFi access but it costs you 3 bucks for 30 minutes. So I'll have to write quick and not tell you about anything uninteressting, Like they serve horse steaks here at the Ibis hotel where we're staying at for one day, before we'll continue our tour to Les Arcs in France. I can't put any pictures online because super-intelligent me forget the usb cable at home. Sorry for that. Wouldn't it be great if all those mobile phone and camera makers would kick their proprietary cables into the dust bin and change them into mini USB ones?</p>
<p>Not risking any diarrhea we decided to dine at a local Lebanese restaurant, tadjine de poission was my choice.</p>
<p>Made some pictures with Sandra's mobile (cow in Lausanne and snow on Arlberg):</p>
