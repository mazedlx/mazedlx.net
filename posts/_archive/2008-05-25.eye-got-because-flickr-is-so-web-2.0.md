                <p><a href="http://www.wogri.com">Wogri</a>, who is a good friend of mine, recently had to go to the hospital. And while he was there he had a brilliant idea: <a href="http://eye-got.com">eye-got.com</a>. A photo sharing website, which is about one thing: showing the world <a href="http://eye-got.com/xO3f8bC ">what you have got</a>.</p>
<p>He is currently working on something to implement your stuff directly into your website or blog, a wordpress plugin will be programmed by myself, as soon as Wogri releases the Eye Got SDK ;-)</p>
<p>Show some support and create an account at eye-got.com, it's really worth it!</p>
