                <p>I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">want must have won't buy one</span> don't know what do to. Apple strictened the contracts so now you can't buy and activate the iPhone yourself, but have to buy and activate it in the shop of an official reseller near you. But I want one, I hate my Windows Mobile piece of crap and I must sync with the office's Exchange server - so there's not really an alternative. Or I'll keep my iPod touch, pay that ten bucks for the software update to 2.0 and sync my contacts and calendars that way. Did I mention that I hate my Windows Mobile piece of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">shit</span> crap?</p>
<p>Apple, I know you don't consider advices of some Austrian kid, but wouldn't you make a whole lot more money if you'd sell the iPhone to anyone? Forget those exclusive contracts, they're so 1990 and give us what we want. iPhone, 16GB, for 200 bucks a piece without the hassle. Maniac said something utterly true about the iPhone:</p>
<blockquote>By the way, iPhones will be sold with exclusive contracts only, it's dead to me now.</blockquote>
<p>Besides: the apps rock!</p>
