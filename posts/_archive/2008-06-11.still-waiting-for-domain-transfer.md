title: Still Waiting For Domain Transfer

                <p>mazedlx.net is still hosted at my old provider. According to my new provider, the transferring process can take up to 72 hours. And what I know is that at least one root dns server has to be informed so the whole world knows about that change - and that will take a few days too. In the meantime be sure to use mazedlx.at.</p>
