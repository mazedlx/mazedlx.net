title: Google Analytics Is The New Webalizer

                <p>I love <a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">webalizer</a> statistics. Lightweight, easy to administer, and reports almost everything you want to know. Almost. Everything else you would like to know about the visitors of your website can be found out via <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, like screen resolution, color-depth and flash player version of your visitors. 800x600px is dead ;-)</p>
