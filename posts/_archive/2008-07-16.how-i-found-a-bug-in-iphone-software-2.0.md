title: How I Found A Bug In iPhone Software 2.0
tags:

                <p>And then realized that I'm just an idiot. When calculating the cube root of a number you'd use a scientific calculator or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_root#Cube_root_on_a_standard_calculator">non-scientific calculator with a little trick</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the new iPhone/iPod touch software features a scientific calculator I tried some functions like the x-th root of y. When you caluclate the cube of 3 we get 27, so the cube root of 27 is 3. And every time I've had hit the 3 after entering 27 &quot;n-th root button&quot; 3 I ended up with 1.4422495. Which is the cube root of 3. Then I tried it with the cube roots of 64 and 125 which resulted in 4 and respectively 5. Then again cube root of 27, and again 1.4422495. I did it. I found a bug. So I tried to call up Greuff and Wogri, who didn't pick up their phones. And then I tried it again. 27 &quot;n-th root button&quot; 3. And then the calculator showed me a result of 3.</p>
<p>What has happened here? Lucky me did hit the &quot;n-th root button&quot; twice every time I tried before. So no bug to file, just my crippled fingers and me thinking that I'm a genius.</p>
