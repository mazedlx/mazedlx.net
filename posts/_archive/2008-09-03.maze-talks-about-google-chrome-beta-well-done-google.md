                <p>Just some notes: looks and feels like Firefox, well done Google! Wasn't able to take the Acid3 test, seems like I am not the only one trying to reach acidtests.org. Well done Google! Chrome is currently available only for Windows, come on Google! Chrome is based upon WebKit, again, well done Google.</p>
