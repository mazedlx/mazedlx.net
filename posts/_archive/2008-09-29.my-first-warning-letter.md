title: My First Warning Letter

                <p>I received a warning letter from Franklin, Weinrib, Rudell &amp; Vassallo, P.C. Attorneys At Law, in New York, telling my provider that mazedlx.net contains and publicly performs unauthorized copies of the movie &quot;Slacker Uprising&quot;. This is not true. Nevertheless I removed the two blog entries as a safety measure. Ah, automated letters, how I love them.</p>
<p>UPDATE: This just came in:</p>
<p class="important">Thank you for your response to my letter of September 24th.
My purpose was to address unauthorized online dissemination of the film "Slacker Uprising" to locations outside the United States and Canada.
If your site at no time contained or disseminated copies of the film, then my information was incorrect and you may consider the letter withdrawn.

And the blog entries are back :-)
