title: Yet Another IE7 Bug
tags:
---


                <p>IE7 didn't execute a window.open command in some JavaScript code I've written. The code looks like</p>
<p class="note">function popup() {
/* some vars */
window.open(url, "Name with some spaces", params);
}

This always resulted in a IE7 runtime error, giving me absolutely no information about what really went wrong. Firefox opened that very window without any hassle (and every other browser too, even IE6). That problem can be solved by removing the spaces in the popups name:
<p class="note">function popup() {
/* some vars */
window.open(url, "Namewithoutspaces", params);
}

Can somebody kill that browser? Thanks in advance.
