<p>Back in 2001 things sucked ass as they do today, like</p>
<blockquote>Get it all done with the most reliable <strong>Windows</strong> ever. <strong>...</strong> <strong>Windows</strong> 2000 SP1 has
the latest in compatibility, setup, reliability, and security updates. <strong>...</strong></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>George W. <strong>Bush</strong> is running for President of the United States to keep the country
prosperous.</blockquote>
<p>and even then</p>
<blockquote><span><strong>Oil price</strong> went up again last week. </span></blockquote>
<p>Seems like nothing has changed.</p>
