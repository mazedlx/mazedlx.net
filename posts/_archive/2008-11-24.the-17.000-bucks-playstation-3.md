<p>Got seventeenthousand (!) bucks to spend on a PlayStation 3 (60GB / Custom Metal Gear Solid 4 design, signed by Hideo Kojima - director of the Metal Gear series - and Yumi Kikuchi - voice of Raging Raven)? You've had your chance - it's gone. More info at <a href="http://kotaku.com/5070003/custom-metal-gear-solid-4-ps3-goes-for-17100">kotaku.com</a>. Well, at least shipping is free.</p>
