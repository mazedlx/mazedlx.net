title: Hello Google Reader, I&#039;m Back From NetNewsWire

                <p>I need my RSS readers to sync, don't want to read yesterdays news when I get home, therefore I use a web interface at work and a proper application at home. I did use <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator's</a> <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx">NetNewsWire</a> since it has gone freeware, and I used the web interace - which sucks ass by the way - at work. Since there's no possibility to sync my Newsgator account with my Google account, and Firefox is always running and one more tab isn't an issue, I say hello to <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx">Google Reader</a>.</p>
