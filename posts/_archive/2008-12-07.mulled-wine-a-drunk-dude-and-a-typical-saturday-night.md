title: Mulled Wine, A Drunk Dude And A Typical Saturday Night
tags:

                <p>I met up with Greuff yesterday to have some mulled wine, although I'm no fan of cheap heated wine adulterated with canned fruits and condiments. Be that as it may, we were standing next to a mulled wine stand when all out of a sudden some dude walked over to me and tried to kiss me on my cheek. Lucky me, I had my hands up in front of my chest and gained some security distance. I was so baffled, the only words that left my mouth were a variation of 'WTF?'. The drunk guy said &quot;Freddy is alive!&quot;, turned around and walked back to his friends who said: &quot;that's enough booze for tonight, we're going home&quot;. By that time it was half past seven. Some other guy behind us stated that even the non-alcoholic children's glogg would be &quot;too sharp&quot; for the obviously drunk and in need for love dude. And I don't even look like Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p>Afterwards we headed to the Rox, a nice pub that opened its gates recently. Greuff and I were caught on film that very night:</p>

<p>Thanks Greuff for the nice evening!</p>
