                <p>I decided to sell my HP 2133 on eBay,  the VIA chipset is just not strong enough. Recently I installed Ubuntu on an Acer Aspire One (A110) and I must say, that boot-up time, overall performance and Compiz fluidity outstand the 2133. HP announced that they're going to build the next-gen Mini-Notes with Intel Chipsets. Good choice, HP.</p>
<p>My new netbook, a Dell Mini 9 (1.6GHz, 16GB SSD HDD, 8.9&quot;, 1024MB RAM) is on its way, should arrive at my desk by Wednesday. Ordering my new gadget wasn't as easy as you might think, because every time I clicked on &quot;Add to cart&quot;, the Dell webshop came up with a &quot;this article could not be found&quot; error message. I used the following workaround: Every Dell product comes with an E-Value code. I looked up the Mini's E-Value code, fed the webshop search, and could finally place my order.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why Dell charges 30 bucks for delivery. That sucks.</p>
