title: The (Dis)Advantages Of Public Transport

                <p>I travel to work and home by train almost every day. Travelling by train is great. Either I'm asleep all the time, or I'm watching TV shows or movies on my iPod. What sucks about travelling by train are delays. And no free seats. And when you've had a twelve hour working day, and some guy sits next to you who smells like a blend of sweat and &quot;last shower: three days ago&quot;. :-P</p>
