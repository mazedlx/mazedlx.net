                <p>Shame on you(tube) for breaking a young girl's heart:</p>
<blockquote>YouTube and Warner Brothers have broken a little girl's heart by deleting a video of her singing the <em>copyrighted</em> song "Winter Wonderland," and the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> isn't going to take it anymore.

The populist legal organization <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/01/youtubes-january-fair-use-massacre">made a post to its blog today</a> arguing that copyright holders became overzealous with their use of YouTube's ContentID tool in January and flagged for deletion many videos that the EFF believes constitute Fair Use. The post puts out a call for people who've lost their content and want to take legal action.

Using YouTube's new automated copright detection technology, Warner Brothers detected last month that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnsZLhI4zb4&amp;feature=channel_page">15 year old Juliet Weybret had posted a video</a> of herself playing the piano and singing the 1934 song <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Wonderland">Winter Wonderland</a>. This unrepentant little criminal might have thought that such a widely covered tune had entered the public domain, 75 years after it was recorded, but Juliet was clearly unfamiliar with legislation like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">Sony Bono Copyright Extension Act</a>, which extended copyright protection to 95 years or more after publication date.</blockquote>
<p>Copyright. It will kill all guitar playing video tutorials. And everything else.</p>
