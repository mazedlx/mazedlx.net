                <p>The lawsuit that was filed against the operaters of thepiratebay.org - in case you didn't know: one of the largest torrent portals in ze web - will be a milestone in P2P history - and may decide its fate. Fear not, even if the pirates go down, P2P will never die. Hold tight guys! And long live Swedish copyright laws!</p>
