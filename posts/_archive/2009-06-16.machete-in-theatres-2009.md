                <p>From <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/06/16/are-you-ready-for-some-danny-trejo-machete-this-year/">firstshowing.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Back in April, Robert Rodriguez <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/04/23/rodriguez-co-directing-machete-with-editor-ethan-maniquis/">announced</a> that he would officially be making <strong><em>Machete</em></strong>, the full-length version of the <em>Grindhouse</em> trailer starring Danny Trejo. Its a project that Trejo has been talking about ever since <em>Grindhouse</em> flopped back in early 2007. But we didn't know it would actually happen until April. Then we started hearing that Rodriguez would be rebooting <em>Predators</em> and that he had a sci-fi action movie called <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/02/19/more-updated-details-on-robert-rodriguezs-nerveracker/"><em>Nerveracker</em></a> in the works, as well as other projects like <em>Sin City 2</em> and <em>The Jetsons</em>. So will it still happen? Yep, definitely! Trejo told <a href="http://gordonandthewhale.com/gatw-exclusive-danny-trejo-not-in-the-expendables/">Gordon &amp; The Whale</a> (via <a href="http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2009/06/machete-is-next-for-robert-rodriguez.html">The Playlist</a>) that they'll begin shooting in <strong>5 weeks</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>Can't hardly wait to see that one! Here's the trailer from the Grindhouse Double Feature:</p>
