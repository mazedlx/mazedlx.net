                <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I have succesfully sent and received MMS. Here is the ipcc file for Orange Austria, use it at your own risk!</p>

<p>I used the following settings for MMS:</p>
<p>APN: Orange.mms
Username: mms
Password: mms
MMSC: <a href="http://mmsc.orange.at/mms/wapenc">http://mmsc.orange.at/mms/wapenc</a>
MMS-Proxy: 194.24.128.118:8080
Max. Messagesize: 300 (don't know if that is correct - but it works)
MMS UUA Prof URL: leave it blank</p>
<p>I managed to install a custom mobileconfig file to get tethering working (thanks to <a href="http://www.benm.at/2009/06/13/helpbenmat/">benm.at</a>), and later to create my very own ipcc file to install via iTunes 8.2, but MMS won't work. So I called up <a href="http://www.orange.at/">Orange</a> support:</p>
<blockquote>Orange: Hell my name is ... how can I help you?

Me: I would like to know when I will be able to send and receive MMS.

Orange: Did you upgrade your iPhone to the latest software?

Me: Yes, I did upgrade to OS 3.0 yesterday.

Orange: Our technicans are working on that. Should be up and running in the next few days. Please be patient

Me: Okay, thanks for the help.</blockquote>
