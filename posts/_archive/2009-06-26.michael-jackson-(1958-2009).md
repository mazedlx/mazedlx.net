                <p>I was never a Michael Jackson fan, nor did I fancy his music, in the 80s I was a Kid, and in the 90s I did already listen to alternative mainstream.
This morning, when I heard that Michael died I said I couldn't care less (what happenend in '93 and '03 lowered my sympathy), and then I <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2003/07/22/michael-jackson-dont.html">found this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Michael Jackson says Congress should make no laws that could land music fans in jail for downloading songs illegally over the Internet. "I am speechless about the idea of putting music fans in jail for downloading music. It is wrong to download, but the answer cannot be jail," Jackson said in a statement released Monday. The pop star was referring to a bill before Congress that would make it a federal felony to obtain copyright works over the Internet without permission.</blockquote>
