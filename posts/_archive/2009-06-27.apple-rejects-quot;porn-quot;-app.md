<blockquote>"Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography," an Apple spokesman told CNN Thursday afternoon. "The developer of this application added inappropriate content directly from their server after the application had been approved and distributed, and after the developer had subsequently been asked to remove some offensive content. This was a direct violation of the terms of the iPhone Developer Program. The application is no longer available on the App Store."</blockquote>
