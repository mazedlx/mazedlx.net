                <p>from <a href="http://www.ie6nomore.com/">ie6nomore.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enough is enough.</span> Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was released in late 2001. For its time, it was a decent browser, but in 2009, it is still in use by a significant portion of the web population, and its time is now up.

As any web developer will tell you, working with IE 6 is one of the most difficult and frustrating things they have to deal with on a daily basis, taking up a disproportionate amount of their time. Beyond that, IE 6's support for modern web standards is very lacking, restricting what developers can create and holding the web back.</blockquote>
