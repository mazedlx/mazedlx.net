title: The Tabbed Browsing Hell
tags:
---


                <p>Do you use a browser that supports tabbed browsing? Of course you do. Do you own a Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, GMail or any other Web 2.0 account? Sure you do. And to use alle those apps at the same time, you'll have to open a plethora of tabs. Damn right you'll have to.
But be not afraid, there is a simple solution to this dilemma, at least with Mac OS X: Fluid:</p>
<blockquote>Fluid includes a Cocoa Plug-in architecture for Fluid SSBs. Currently, Fluid ships with two plug-ins bundled, the Thumbnail Plug-in and the Clipboard Plug-in.  The Thumbnail Plug-in allows you to browse the Web with Cover Flow or iPhoto-like thumbnail previews of links on the current page. The Clipboard Plug-in allows you to drag images, links, text, and other web content to a "clipboard" area. Plug-ins can appear in many places in the SSB user interface: in split-panes, floating windows or drawers. Visit the Preferences window of your SSB to see the Thumnbnail and Clipboard Plug-ins' preference panes where you can specify your preferred locations.</blockquote>
<p>So far I've created two apps, one for Facebook, one for Google Reader:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Enter the desired website you want to be its own app:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5039" title="fluid_app" src="/uploads/2009/08/fluid_app.png" alt="fluid_app" width="522" height="287" /></li>
    <li>Click Create. And you're done.
<a href="/uploads/2009/08/fluid_google_reader.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5041" title="fluid_google_reader" src="/uploads/2009/08/fluid_google_reader-300x208.png" alt="fluid_google_reader" width="300" height="208" />
</a><a href="/uploads/2009/08/fluid_facebook.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5042" title="fluid_facebook" src="/uploads/2009/08/fluid_facebook-300x201.png" alt="fluid_facebook" width="300" height="201" /></a></li>
    <li>If you like nice icons for your apps be sure to check out<a href="http://csi.nfshost.com/goodies/"> Chris Ivarson's site</a> and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/fluid_icons/">Fluid Icons group on Flickr</a>:

</ol>
<blockquote>And here is a list of additional benefits when using Fluid:
<div id="pageWrap">
<ul id="featureList">
    <li><strong>Site Specific Browsing.</strong> Specify a Home URL when you create an SSB with Fluid to keep your SSB browsing targeted. Whenever you click on a link outside of the Home URL's domain, Fluid will send the page request to your system default Browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Whitelists and Blacklists.</strong> Fluid's powerful pattern matching feature allows you to specify multiple URL patterns for allowing or disallowing browsing to specific URL patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Tabbed Browsing.</strong> Optionally enable Tabbed Browsing, just like in Safari.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Software Updates.</strong> Both Fluid SSBs and Fluid itself leverage the Sparkle Update Framework for dead-simple, one-click software updates. Fluid automatically checks for new updates in the background, so keeping your SSBs up to date is a snap.</li>
    <li><strong>Userscripting.</strong> Fluid SSBs include built-in support for GreaseMonkey-compatible Userscripting. No PlugIns are required or used for this feature... Userscripting is baked right in for your hacking pleasure.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom SSB Icons.</strong> When an SSB is created, choose from a custom local Icon, the WebApp's Favicon (or even the WebApp's "apple-touch-icon" if available). Find and share high-quality custom Icons at the <a href="http://www.fluidapp.com/customicons">Fluid Flickr Icon Group</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Dock Badges.</strong> Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Facebook, and Flickr SSBs display "unread message count" Dock Badges just like Apple Mail.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Restore.</strong> Upon quitting, Fluid SSBs will store your window sizes, locations on screen, and open tabs -- and then immediately restore them the next time launch.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Browser.</strong> An iPhoto-like view of all photos on any page viewed in any SSB.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal UI.</strong> By default, SSBs created by Fluid feature a very minimal user interface, allowing your favorite WebApps to be the star. However, you'll eventually miss that Back Button, Search Field, or Bookmark Bar. No worries, the SSB UI is totally configurable with hide-able/show-able Toolbar, Address Field, Search Field, Bookmark Bar, Tabs Bar, and Status Bar and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Full-Screen Browsing.</strong> Fluid SSBs support "Full-Screen" mode.</li>
    <li><strong>TinyURL.</strong> Fluid SSBs include a built-in "Make TinyURL for This Page" command for convenient linking.</li>
    <li><strong>Bookmarks.</strong> Bookmarks are nice, but Bookmarklets are essential. Fluid SSBs include a simple Bookmark manager including a Bookmarks Bar UI similar to Safari and Firefox. Great for Bookmarklets.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom User-Agent Strings.</strong> Choose from several convenient User-Agent Strings for popular browsers, or provide your own.</li>
    <li><strong>Resizable Search Field.</strong> Google search the entire web or just the SSB's Home URL domain.</li>
    <li><strong>RSS/Atom Feed Detection.</strong> Fluid SSBs auto-detect RSS and Atom Feeds. Click the 'RSS' button, and you'll be wisked away to your system default Feed Reader with an option to subscribe to the feed.</li>
    <li><strong>Browsing History.</strong> SSBs feature a History menu identical to Safari's.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Preferences.</strong> Much like Safari, configure Fluid SSBs to enable/disable PlugIns, Java, JavaScript. Also select your preferred default Fonts, block Image loading, and much more.</li>
    <li><strong>Download Manager.</strong> Many WebApps require Download support... like the "Export" feature in Google Docs for example. Fluid sports a minimal Download Manager.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript API.</strong> WebApp creators can use <a href="http://www.fluidapp.com/developer">Fluid's JavaScript API</a> to show Dock Badges, Growl Notifications and create Dock menu items.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript Console.</strong> For convenient JavaScript debugging.</li>
    <li><strong>Growl Notifications.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Popup Blocker.</strong></li>
</ul>
