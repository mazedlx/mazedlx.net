                <p>Okay, this is the worst case scenario, but what if providers decide to kill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">net neutrality</a> and start to charge per packet?</p>

<blockquote>It's alarmist, over-the-top pro-<a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/net-neutrality">net-neutrality</a> propaganda, sure, but <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9yj1f/heres_a_new_scenario_i_just_created_illustrating/">this chart</a> goes a long way to explaining why the IT dude at the office wears that "<a href="http://skreened.com/someofnothing/net-neutrality-tee-all-packets-are-created-equal">All Packets are Created Equal</a>" shirt to work every Thursday: because tiered ISPs are <em>scary</em>.                               And before you dismiss the chart outright, check out your cable company's channel packages. Replace content provider fees with new network backbone charges, and cable packages with traffic or website packages, and hey, look, <em>shit</em>â€”this doesn't seem so crazy, does it?</blockquote>
