                <p>...die man machen kann während man auf ein <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/03/apocalyps3/">Update von Sony wartet, welches die PlayStation 3 wieder zum Starten bringt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>10. Pretend you’re in <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/12/touring-playsta/"><em>PlayStation Home</em></a>: Invite a bunch of weird-looking dudes over to your house and do the Cabbage Patch in your living room.

9. Pull out your PlayStation 2. Reminisce about the good old days when game consoles were free-standing appliances that didn’t need to ping a central server before they allowed you to play.

8. Make a game out of your household chores: “Hooray! I just unlocked the Elbow Grease Trophy in <cite>PixelJunk Fridge-Cleaner</cite>!”

7. Play real-life <cite><a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2006/12/gran_turismo_4_/">Gran Turismo</a></cite>: Take your used Toyota hatchback out on the freeway and rev it up to 55. Ah, this is the life. Who needs racing games? Hey, <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/">Click and Clack </a>are on NPR.

6. Stand outside by your mailbox, waiting for friend requests.

5. Play the Xbox 360, which has an internal clock that does <em>not</em> have a horrible kill-switch built into it. AARGH.

4. Break out the Pledge and clean the dust off your Wii. Bonus: Clean off all your unused peripherals, too — by the time you’re wiping the last of the grime off the Wii Wheel, the bug will be fixed.

3. Read our <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/02/the-tester-episode-2/">recaps of <cite>The Tester</cite></a> instead of watching the actual show. (Note: This tip still applies even after your PlayStation 3 starts working again.)

2. Make a list of 10 things to do while your PlayStation 3 is broken.

1. Get your old box of Little League baseball trophies out of the basement, and award them to yourself. Take them to bed with you, comforted in the knowledge that Sony cannot take <em>these</em> away from you (until at least the PlayStation 5).</blockquote>

<p>Ich hab zwar &quot;nur&quot; eine Wii, aber die funktioniert.</p>
