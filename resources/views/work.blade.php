        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            Are you in need of a website for your company? Or even a web application to digitize your business processes? Bog-standard is not for you? Then you have come to the right place! I craft your website by hand. And your blog. And your CMS. And your super-duper customizable web application. Mobile-first and responsive. From draft to implementation. I'm your one-stop web development shop. I even handle web servers, databases, backups, hosting and other black magic. You have the idea, and I have the fitting technology stack. <br><br>

            And speaking of technology stacks, here is mine in case you're interested:

            <ul>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Laravel</li>
                <li>Livewire</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Vue.js / Alpine.js</li>
                <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
                <li>MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Mobile and Desktop Applications</h2>
        <p>Would you like a nifty smartphone app? Are you interested in having your web application as a native desktop or mobile app? I would love to advise you!</p>

        <h2>Trainings</h2>
        <p>Would you like to bring your developers up to speed? I offer PHP (e.g. testing with PHPUnit and Pest, Laravel) and JavaScript training (e.g. Vue.js, Alpine.js).</p>

        <h2>Consulting</h2>
        <p>Do you want to focus on your business and not your IT? Then, I am your competent and reliable partner that takes care, beginning with your first computer.</p>
